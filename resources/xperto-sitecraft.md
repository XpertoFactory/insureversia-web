# Xperto SiteCraft

## OVERVIEW

Xperto SiteCraft is a comprehensive AI-assisted web design framework. Our methodology provides clarity, purpose, and creative direction that guides design, tone, structure, and every component of each site and project.

### Our Approach to Web Design

We don't just build websites. We craft digital experiences that connect brands with their audiences across languages and cultures. Our expert strategy combines deep human conceptualization with cutting-edge interactivity to create websites that are not only visually stunning but also highly effective.

Every project begins with understanding the essence of your brand. We define the soul of the website before crafting its skin. This gives us clarity, purpose, and the creative direction that guides designs, tones and structures every component of the site and project.

### Our AI Integration Philosophy

Beyond just using AI to do things faster and easier—we leverage AI to do things better, do more things, and do new things. That's our exponential advantage.

AI does not replace our teams nor merely automate simple tasks or complex processes. 

Our human experts take care of the creative process while AI diligently executes with blazing speed, astounding detail and technical precision our original vision. Together our human experts and AI are able to explore possibilities and stretch the boundaries of creativity and productivity.

##### Creative Designer ↔ Visual Design Expert Boundary

The Creative Designer defines the conceptual and thematic foundation (the *what* and *why*), while the Visual Design Expert handles the systematic execution (the *how*). When mood boards or creative concepts conflict with design system constraints (e.g., a conceptual direction that cannot meet contrast requirements or scale across breakpoints), the Visual Design Expert raises the conflict and the two roles negotiate a resolution. If no agreement is reached, the Creative Designer's thematic intent is preserved and the Visual Design Expert documents alternative implementations that honor the intent within technical constraints.

* **Content Strategist** leads IA definition: sitemap, content hierarchy, navigation structure, content types
* **UX Expert** validates IA through user journey mapping, wireframes, and flow diagrams
* **Feedback loop:** UX wireframes may reveal IA issues (too deep, missing paths, confusing groupings) → Content Strategist revises IA → UX Expert re-validates
* **Joint deliverable:** The final Information Architecture is approved by both roles before entering the Design phase gate
* **Conflict resolution:** When content organization logic and user experience patterns conflict, the UX Expert's user-testing data takes precedence; when no data exists, the Content Strategist's domain expertise takes precedence

### Iteration Protocols

#### Micro-Iterations (Within Phase)

Each expert produces drafts that receive feedback from adjacent experts before finalization:

```
Expert Draft → Adjacent Expert Review → Refinement → Validation → Finalization
```

##### Examples

* Brand Strategist draft → Communications Expert review → Brand DNA refinement  
* Creative Designer concepts → Visual Design Expert feasibility check → Creative direction finalization  
* UX Wireframes → UI Expert implementation review → Wireframe refinement

#### Macro-Iterations (Between Phases)

Insights from later phases can trigger reviews in earlier phases:

```
Execution Insight → Design Review → Conceptualization Adjustment (if needed)
```

##### Triggers for Macro-Iteration

* Technical constraints discovered during execution
* User testing reveals conceptual misalignment
* Performance requirements impact design decisions
* Client feedback requires strategic adjustment

#### Iteration Conflict Resolution

When adjacent experts disagree during micro- or macro-iterations:

1. **Document** — Both parties articulate their position with specific evidence (user data, brand alignment, technical constraints)
2. **Reference** — Ground the discussion in project artifacts: Brand DNA, Website Goals, Target Audience Personas
3. **Negotiate** — Experts attempt to find a solution that addresses both concerns within one iteration cycle
4. **Escalate** — If unresolved after one cycle, the Project Manager arbitrates using this priority order:
   * User data and testing results (highest weight)
   * Brand DNA alignment
   * Technical feasibility
   * Expert domain expertise
5. **Record** — Document the decision and rationale in the phase retrospective for future reference

> **Iteration limits:** Micro-iterations should resolve within 2 cycles. If a third cycle is needed, the Project Manager must be involved. Macro-iterations require Project Manager approval before initiating.

#### Retrospective Protocol

At each phase gate, conduct a brief retrospective:

* What worked well?
* What could be improved?
* What learnings apply to future phases?
* What adjustments needed for this project?

##### Output: Phase Retrospective Summary

**Owner:** Project Manager

The retrospective produces a "Phase Retrospective Summary" containing:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Phase | [Phase name and duration] |
| Participants | [Roles involved] |
| Strengths | [What worked well — specific examples] |
| Improvements | [What could be improved — specific examples] |
| Learnings | [Key insights for future phases] |
| Action Items | [Specific changes to apply in next phase] |

> **Feed-forward requirement:** Action items from the retrospective must be reviewed at the start of the next phase kickoff. The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring learnings are applied.

> **Directory Structure vs. Site Map:** The Directory Structure above defines the physical file organization on disk. The Site Map defines the logical content architecture as presented to users. Both should align on top-level sections, but the Site Map may include additional navigational groupings or content types that do not correspond 1:1 to physical directories (e.g., filtered views, tag-based listings). When adding pages, update both to maintain consistency.

##### Translation vs. Localization

Xperto SiteCraft distinguishes between two fundamentally different multilingual strategies. Projects should explicitly decide which approach — or which combination — applies to each content type.

**Translation** is converting the same content into another language. The meaning, examples, references, and structure stay identical — only the language changes.

**Localization** is adapting the content's substance — not just its language — to be native to the target culture, market, or jurisdiction. Localized content may use different examples, reference different institutions, cite different authorities, adjust humor and tone, and reorder priorities based on what matters to that specific audience.

| Dimension | Translation | Localization |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Language** | Changed | Changed |
| **Examples & references** | Same (translated) | Adapted to local context |
| **Institutions & authorities** | Same (translated names) | Replaced with local equivalents |
| **Cultural tone** | Preserved from source | Calibrated to target culture |
| **Legal/regulatory references** | Same | Jurisdiction-specific |
| **Imagery & metaphors** | Same | Culturally appropriate alternatives |
| **Content structure** | Identical | May reorder for local priorities |
| **Effort per language** | Lower | Higher |
| **Authenticity** | Feels translated | Feels native |

**When to Localize vs. Translate:**

| Content Type | Recommended Approach |
| :---- | :---- |
| UI elements (buttons, labels, navigation) | Translation |
| Legal/regulatory content | Localization |
| Examples, case studies, scenarios | Localization |
| Educational content with cultural references | Localization |
| Technical/factual content | Translation (with terminology verification) |
| Marketing/persuasive content | Localization |
| Community/editorial content | Localization |
| FAQ / Support content | Hybrid — structure translated, specifics localized |

**Localization Planning Per Language:**

For each supported language, the Content Strategist should produce a Localization Brief specifying:
* Which content types are translation-only vs. fully localized
* Cultural adaptations required (tone shifts, humor calibration, formality level)
* Local references to substitute (institutions, authorities, examples, case law, regulations)
* Local terminology mapping (domain-specific terms that vary by region within the same language)
* Regional variations within a language (e.g., European Spanish vs. Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese vs. European Portuguese)
* Local credibility signals (certifications, affiliations, endorsements that matter in-market)

##### Translation & Localization Implementation

* `data-i18n` attributes on translatable elements
* Shared i18n module (`/js/i18n.js`) with centralized namespace
* Page-specific translations object listens for `site-language-change` event
* Language persisted in `localStorage` as `preferredLanguage`
* Auto-detect browser language on first visit
* URL structure options:
  * Subdirectory: `/es/about/`, `/fr/about/`
  * Subdomain: `es.domain.com`, `fr.domain.com`
  * Query parameter: `?lang=es` (not recommended for SEO)
* For localized content: separate content files per language (not just string replacement)
* Content publishing rule: define per-project whether new content is held until all languages are ready, or published language-by-language

### Modular CSS Architecture

#### Shared CSS Modules (`/css/`)

| File | Purpose | Contents |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `fonts.css` | Typography imports | Google Fonts or self-hosted font declarations |

### Web Framework Decision

Not every website requires the same architecture. A blog, a SaaS dashboard, and a multilingual corporate site have fundamentally different needs. This section provides a decision framework for selecting the right web architecture — a choice that affects deliverables, prompts, and implementation patterns throughout the SiteCraft workflow.

#### Framework Options

| Framework Type | Description | Best For | Trade-offs |
|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Static HTML** | Hand-coded HTML/CSS/JS, no build step | Simple sites (< 10 pages), maximum control, no dependencies | Manual updates, no templating, scales poorly |
| **Static Site Generator (SSG)** | Build-time rendering (Astro, Hugo, 11ty, Jekyll) | Content-heavy sites, blogs, documentation, multilingual | Build step required, limited dynamic features without JS |
| **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** | Request-time rendering (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit) | Dynamic content, personalization, authenticated sections | Server infrastructure required, higher hosting cost |
| **Single Page Application (SPA)** | Client-side rendering (React, Vue, Svelte) | Highly interactive apps, dashboards, tools | Poor SEO without SSR/SSG hybrid, large initial JS bundle |
| **CMS-Based** | Content management system (WordPress, Strapi, Sanity, Payload) | Client-managed content, editorial workflows, frequent updates | CMS dependency, potential performance overhead, plugin risks |
| **Hybrid** | Combination (e.g., SSG + SPA islands, SSR + static pages) | Complex sites with mixed needs | Architecture complexity, requires experienced team |

#### Decision Criteria

| Criterion | Questions to Answer | Impact on Choice |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Complexity** | How many pages? How many content types? How many languages? | More complexity → SSG or CMS; 5 static pages → plain HTML |
| **Interactivity** | Do pages need real-time updates, user input, or state management? | High interactivity → SPA or Hybrid; mostly static → SSG |
| **Content Volume** | How often is content added/updated? Who updates it? | Frequent non-technical updates → CMS; developer-managed → SSG or static |
| **SEO Requirements** | Is organic search a primary traffic source? | SEO-critical → SSG or SSR; internal tool → SPA is fine |
| **Team Capability** | What does the development team know? What can they maintain? | Match to team skills; don't choose Next.js if the team knows WordPress |
| **Budget** | What are hosting, licensing, and maintenance budgets? | Static/SSG = cheapest hosting; CMS = licensing; SSR = server costs |
| **Maintenance** | Who maintains this after launch? What's their technical level? | Non-technical maintainers → CMS; developer team → any |
| **Performance** | What are the Core Web Vitals targets? | Strictest targets → SSG or static; dynamic content can still perform with SSR |
| **Scalability** | Will the site grow significantly in pages or traffic? | Rapid content growth → CMS or SSG with headless CMS |

#### SiteCraft Workflow Integration

The framework choice affects several downstream deliverables:

| SiteCraft Deliverable | Impact |
|-----------------------|--------|
| **Directory Structure** | Adapts to framework conventions (e.g., `/src/pages/` for Astro, `/app/` for Next.js, theme structure for WordPress) |
| **CSS Architecture** | May use framework-specific patterns (CSS Modules, Tailwind, scoped styles) instead of global CSS files |
| **JS Architecture** | May be replaced by framework's component model (React components, Vue SFCs, Astro islands) |
| **HTML Template** | Replaced by framework templates (JSX, Astro components, PHP templates) |
| **Multilingual Implementation** | Framework-specific i18n (next-intl, astro-i18n, WPML) replaces vanilla `i18n.js` |
| **Performance Standards** | Targets remain the same; measurement approach may differ |
| **Flavor System Implementation** | CSS custom property approach stays; delivery mechanism adapts (build-time vs. runtime) |
| **Deployment & Hosting** | Static → CDN (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages); SSR → edge/serverless; CMS → managed hosting |

* Content Strategist (for CMS selection if CMS-based framework chosen)
```

### UI Framework Decision

Independently of the web framework, every project must decide how visual design is implemented in code. The UI framework choice determines how the Visual Design System, Style Guide, and Flavor System are translated into CSS and components.

#### Framework Options

| Framework Type | Description | Examples | Best For |
|----------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Custom CSS** | Hand-written CSS from scratch, BEM or similar methodology | Vanilla CSS, CSS Modules, Sass | Maximum design uniqueness, full control, small teams with strong CSS skills |
| **Utility-First** | Composable utility classes, minimal custom CSS | Tailwind CSS, UnoCSS | Rapid development, consistent spacing/sizing, design-system alignment |
| **Component Library** | Pre-built, themed UI components | shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Headless UI, daisyUI | Fast development, accessibility built-in, consistent patterns |
| **Design System Framework** | Opinionated, comprehensive design systems | Material UI (MUI), Chakra UI, Ant Design | Enterprise apps, dashboards, teams familiar with the system |
| **CSS-in-JS** | Styles co-located with components | Styled Components, Emotion, Vanilla Extract | Dynamic theming, scoped styles, component-level encapsulation |

#### Decision Criteria

| Criterion | Questions to Answer | Impact on Choice |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Design Uniqueness** | How distinctive must the visual identity be? | Unique brand → Custom CSS or Utility-First; standard UI → Component Library |
| **Development Speed** | What is the timeline pressure? | Tight deadline → Component Library or Design System Framework |
| **Accessibility** | What WCAG level is required? Is the team experienced with a11y? | Limited a11y experience → Component Library with built-in accessibility |
| **Bundle Size** | What is the performance budget for CSS/JS? | Strict budget → Utility-First (purged) or Custom CSS; avoid large design system frameworks |
| **Flavor System Support** | How complex are Flavor variations? | Heavy Flavor use → CSS custom properties (works with any approach); many component-level changes → CSS-in-JS or Utility-First |
| **Team Familiarity** | What does the team know? | Match to team skills for maintainability |
| **Maintenance** | Who maintains styles post-launch? | Non-developers → fewer custom CSS files; Component Library with documented props |

#### Integration with SiteCraft Deliverables

| SiteCraft Deliverable | How UI Framework Affects It |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Visual Design System** | Token format adapts: CSS custom properties (universal), Tailwind config, theme object, design tokens JSON |
| **Style Guide** | Component documentation format changes: CSS classes vs. component props vs. utility compositions |
| **Flavor System** | Implementation mechanism: CSS custom property overrides (universal), Tailwind theme extensions, theme provider props |
| **Component Library Specs** | Abstraction level changes: raw HTML/CSS specs vs. component API specs vs. utility class compositions |
| **CSS Architecture** | File structure changes: BEM modules vs. Tailwind config vs. component-scoped styles |
| **Accessibility Audit** | Testing approach adjusts: manual ARIA vs. built-in component library accessibility |

* Hyphenated for multi-word names (e.g., `about-us`, `case-study`)  
* No spaces or special characters  
* Descriptive, SEO-friendly names

##### Examples

| ✓ Correct | ✗ Incorrect |
| :---- | :---- |

| `/blog/my-first-post/` | `/blog/My_First_Post/` |
| `/assets/images/hero-banner.jpg` | `/assets/images/Hero Banner.JPG` |

### Code Style Guidelines

#### HTML Standards

* 4-space indentation (consistent throughout)  
* Semantic HTML5 elements  
* Meaningful `class` names (BEM or similar methodology)  
* `data-` attributes for JavaScript hooks  
* `data-i18n` attributes for translatable content  
* Accessibility attributes (`aria-`, `role`, `alt`)  
* Comments for major sections

#### CSS Standards

* Mobile-first responsive approach  
* CSS custom properties for theming  
* BEM naming convention for components  
* Logical property grouping:  
  1. Layout (display, position, flex/grid)  
  2. Box model (margin, padding, border)  
  3. Typography (font, text, color)  
  4. Visual (background, shadow, opacity)  
  5. Animation (transition, transform)

#### Iconography Standards

* **Do not use emojis** in website content, UI elements, or code unless specifically requested by the client. Emojis are informal and non-professional.
* Use **SVG icons** for all iconography — either from a curated library (Lucide, Heroicons) or custom-designed SVGs aligned with the Visual Design System.
* SVG icons must be accessible: include `aria-label` or `aria-hidden="true"` with adjacent text labels as appropriate.

#### Character & People Imagery Standards

All imagery, illustrations, AI-generated visuals, and photography featuring people must follow these representation and styling guidelines. These apply to hero images, section images, persona illustrations, testimonial photos, team photos, marketing materials, and any visual content produced through the protocol.

##### Character Representation

* **Ethnicity and appearance:** Characters must be Hispanic, Mediterranean, and Latino. Feature dark hair consistently. Do not use Anglo-Saxon or Caucasian character representations.
* **Diversity within scope:** Represent the full range of Hispanic, Mediterranean, and Latino communities — varying skin tones, ages, body types, and cultural backgrounds within these groups.
* **Authenticity:** Avoid stereotypical or caricatured portrayals. Characters should look like real people in professional, everyday, or aspirational contexts appropriate to the brand.

##### Wardrobe Guidelines

| Context | Appropriate | Not Appropriate |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Professional / formal** | Tailored suits, blazers (lightweight fabrics), dress shirts, structured dresses, linen trousers | Heavy overcoats, layered winter business wear |
| **Business casual** | Lightweight button-downs, polo shirts, chinos, sundresses, smart separates | Woven/wool sweaters, chunky knits, fleece |
| **Casual** | Linen shirts, cotton tees, light dresses, shorts, tropical prints, sandals | Wool sweaters, heavy denim jackets, beanies |
| **Active / outdoor** | Athletic wear, light jackets, sun-protective clothing | Parkas, ski wear, heavy boots |

* **Climate:** All wardrobe choices must be suitable for warm weather and tropical climates. Fabrics should read as light, breathable, and comfortable — linen, cotton, silk, lightweight blends.
* **Never use:** Woven sweaters, wool sweaters, heavy knits, cable-knit pullovers, thick scarves, winter hats, or cold-weather layering in any character imagery.
* **Seasonal Flavors:** Even for winter-themed or holiday Flavors, characters should wear warm-weather interpretations — e.g., a festive linen guayabera rather than a Christmas sweater.

##### Application Across Prompts

These standards apply whenever an image brief, visual concept, or asset specification involves people:

* Hero Image briefs (Creative Designer)
* Section Image briefs (Graphic Designer)
* Persona visual descriptions (Market / User Research Specialist)
* Video production briefs (Creative Designer)
* AI image generation prompts
* Stock photography selection criteria
* Illustration style guides

> **Prompt enforcement:** When generating image briefs, include an explicit line: *"Characters: Hispanic/Mediterranean/Latino appearance, dark hair. Wardrobe: warm-weather appropriate — no wool, knit, or cold-climate clothing."*

#### JavaScript Standards

* ES6+ syntax with appropriate transpilation  
* Modular structure with clear namespacing  
* Event delegation where possible  
* Meaningful variable and function names  
* JSDoc comments for public methods  
* Error handling and graceful degradation

### Responsive Breakpoints

| Name | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `xs` | 0 | 639px | Small phones |
| `sm` | 640px | 767px | Large phones |
| `md` | 768px | 1023px | Tablets |
| `lg` | 1024px | 1279px | Small laptops |
| `xl` | 1280px | 1535px | Desktops |
| `2xl` | 1536px | ∞ | Large screens |

#### CSS Custom Properties & Media Queries

The breakpoint system uses a mobile-first approach with `min-width` media queries. Define breakpoint values as CSS custom properties in `variables.css`:

```css
:root {
  --bp-sm: 640px;
  --bp-md: 768px;
  --bp-lg: 1024px;
  --bp-xl: 1280px;
  --bp-2xl: 1536px;
}

/* Mobile-first media query pattern */
/* Base styles: xs (0-639px) — no media query needed */
@media (min-width: 640px)  { /* sm */ }
@media (min-width: 768px)  { /* md */ }
@media (min-width: 1024px) { /* lg */ }
@media (min-width: 1280px) { /* xl */ }
@media (min-width: 1536px) { /* 2xl */ }
```

> **Note:** CSS custom properties cannot be used directly in media queries. The values above are for reference; use the literal pixel values in `@media` rules. If using a preprocessor or PostCSS, map these to build-time variables.

### Performance Standards

#### Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | \< 2.5s | Time to largest content element |
| Interaction to Next Paint (INP) | \< 200ms | Input responsiveness |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | \< 0.1 | Visual stability score |
| Time to First Byte (TTFB) | \< 600ms | Server response time |

### Page Structure Template

#### PAGE ELEMENTS

For each page, the workflow defines:

| Element | Description | i18n Requirement |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Title** | Page title and SEO title | Translated per language; SEO title may vary by market |
| **Byline or Subtitle** | Supporting headline | Translated; may adapt culturally |
| **Hero Image/Video** | Primary visual | May need regional variants; alt text translated |
| **Goal of the page** | What this page must accomplish | Internal reference — not translated |
| **Nature of the page** | Informative, interactive, sales, support, institutional, reference, etc. | Internal reference — not translated |
| **Introductory paragraph** | Opening content | Fully translated and localized |
| **Sections of the page** | Content blocks with hierarchy | Fully translated; section order may vary by locale |
| **Media elements** | Images, videos, graphics needed | Alt text translated; captions/subtitles per language |
| **External reference links** | Outbound links | Locale-appropriate link targets where available |
| **Internal links and CTAs** | Navigation and conversion elements | CTA text translated; link targets use locale prefix |
| **SEO specifications** | Keywords, metadata, schema | Per-language keyword research and metadata |
| **Accessibility requirements** | ARIA labels, alt text, etc. | All ARIA labels and alt text translated per language |

#### HTML TEMPLATE

Standard HTML boilerplate for all pages:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="light">
<head>
    <!-- Theme anti-flash: apply saved theme before any rendering to prevent a flash of wrong theme -->
    <script>
        (function(){var t=localStorage.getItem('theme');if(t==='dark'||(!t&&matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme:dark)').matches)){document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme','dark')}})();
    </script>
    <meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">

    <!-- Google Analytics (GA4 tracking snippet — loads the measurement library) -->
    <!-- Note: analytics.js (in /js/) provides an abstraction layer for custom events,
         conversion tracking, and Flavor-aware analytics. It builds on top of this
         base GA4 snippet — the two are complementary, not duplicative. -->
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>

#### Article/Blog Post Meta Tag Variant

For blog posts and articles, replace `og:type` with `article` and add article-specific metadata:

```html
    <!-- Open Graph: Article type (replaces og:type "website" on blog/post pages) -->
    <meta property="og:type" content="article">
    <meta property="article:published_time" content="2026-02-17T10:00:00Z">
    <meta property="article:modified_time" content="2026-02-17T12:30:00Z">
    <meta property="article:author" content="https://www.domain.com/about/team/">
    <meta property="article:section" content="Category Name">
    <meta property="article:tag" content="keyword1">
    <meta property="article:tag" content="keyword2">
```

> **When to use:** Any page with dated, authored content — blog posts, news articles, case studies. The `article:published_time` and `article:modified_time` values must be ISO 8601 format. Platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest use these for rich preview cards.

#### OG Image Specifications

All `og:image` and `twitter:image` values **must be absolute URLs** (e.g., `https://www.domain.com/assets/images/og-image.jpg`). Relative paths will fail silently on most platforms.

| Property | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Dimensions** | 1200 × 630 px (1.91:1 aspect ratio) — universal across platforms |
| **Format** | JPEG for photographs; PNG for graphics, text overlays, or transparency |
| **File size** | Under 300 KB (required for WhatsApp); under 1 MB for all other platforms |
| **Maximum** | 5 MB practical maximum; 8 MB Facebook hard limit |
| **Color space** | sRGB |
| **Safe zone** | Keep critical content (text, logos) within the center 80% — platforms crop differently |

| Platform | Recommended Size | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Facebook / Meta | 1200 × 630 | Standard OG; text-heavy images may be penalized in ads |
| X / Twitter | 1200 × 675 | 16:9 aspect; minimum 300 × 157 |
| LinkedIn | 1200 × 627 | Minimum 1200 px wide or 627 px tall |
| WhatsApp | 1200 × 630 | **Strict 300 KB file size limit** — compress aggressively |
| Pinterest | 1200 × 630 | For link previews; native pins prefer 1000 × 1500 (2:3) |
| Discord / Slack / Telegram | 1200 × 630 | All read standard OG tags |

> **One image for all platforms:** A single 1200 × 630 JPEG under 300 KB works everywhere. Include `og:image:width`, `og:image:height`, and `og:image:type` so platforms can render the preview card immediately without fetching and measuring the image first.

#### Social Meta Tag Fallback Behavior

Not all tags need to be duplicated between OG and Twitter. X/Twitter falls back to OG tags when its own tags are absent:

| Twitter Tag | Falls Back To | Must Be Explicit? |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `twitter:card` | *(no fallback)* | **Yes — always required** |
| `twitter:title` | `og:title` | No (but recommended for length control) |
| `twitter:description` | `og:description` | No (but recommended) |
| `twitter:image` | `og:image` | No |
| `twitter:image:alt` | `og:image:alt` | No |
| `twitter:site` | *(no fallback)* | Yes — brand @handle |
| `twitter:creator` | *(no fallback)* | Yes — author @handle (if applicable) |

LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, Slack, Discord, and Telegram all read standard OG tags exclusively — no proprietary tag namespaces.

> **Cache clearing:** After updating OG tags, use platform debugger tools to refresh cached previews: Facebook Sharing Debugger, LinkedIn Post Inspector, X Card Validator.

```

#### Footer Implementation

* Dynamic injection via `footer.js`
* Translatable content with `data-i18n` attributes
* Links to related brands/companies

#### Footer Accessibility Requirements

* The `<footer>` element serves as a landmark (`role="contentinfo"` is implicit)
* Social media links must include accessible names (e.g., `aria-label="Follow us on LinkedIn"`)
* Legal links (Privacy, Terms, Accessibility) must be present and keyboard-navigable
* Footer navigation uses a `<nav aria-label="Footer navigation">` wrapper
* All footer content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios against the footer background
* Copyright with dynamic year
* Optional: Social media links, contact info, legal links

### Social Sharing Architecture

Every shareable element on the site should provide a frictionless, on-page sharing experience. Instead of navigating users away from the page, sharing opens an in-page modal that lets users select a platform, preview the share content, and confirm — then returns them to exactly where they were.

#### Share Levels

Sharing applies at three distinct levels, each with its own data context:

| Level | What is Shared | Where the Share Icon Appears | Share Data Source |
|-------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Site-level** | The website itself | Header, footer, or persistent floating action | Site-wide OG tags (`og:site_name`, homepage URL, brand image) |
| **Page-level** | The current page | Page header area, end of content, floating action | Page-specific OG/meta tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) |
| **Item-level** | An individual content item (article, service, portfolio piece, product, etc.) | Inline with each item in lists, cards, or detail views | Item-specific structured data: title, description, image, and canonical URL |

#### Share Data Model

Every shareable element exposes four pieces of information to the share modal:

| Field | Source | Fallback |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Title** | `og:title` / item heading / `<title>` | Page `<title>` stripped of site name suffix |
| **Description** | `og:description` / item excerpt / `meta[name=description]` | First 160 characters of visible content |
| **Image** | `og:image` / item featured image | Site-wide default share image — must be absolute URL, 1200×630 px, under 300 KB (see OG Image Specifications) |
| **URL** | `og:url` / item canonical URL | `window.location.href` (cleaned of tracking parameters) |

> **Absolute URLs required:** All image and URL values passed to share platforms must be fully qualified (`https://...`). Relative paths will fail on external platforms.

These values are passed to the share modal via `data-share-*` attributes on the share trigger element:

```html
<!-- Page-level share trigger -->
<button class="share-trigger"
    data-share-title="Page Title"
    data-share-description="Page description"
    data-share-image="/assets/images/page-og.jpg"
    data-share-url="https://www.domain.com/page/"
    aria-label="Share this page">
    <svg class="icon-share" aria-hidden="true"><!-- share icon --></svg>
</button>

<!-- Item-level share trigger (inside a card or list item) -->
<button class="share-trigger"
    data-share-title="Article Title"
    data-share-description="Article excerpt..."
    data-share-image="/assets/images/articles/article-thumb.jpg"
    data-share-url="https://www.domain.com/blog/article-slug/"
    aria-label="Share Article Title">
    <svg class="icon-share" aria-hidden="true"><!-- share icon --></svg>
</button>
```

#### Share Modal Behavior

The share modal is a single, reusable component injected by `share.js`. When a user clicks any share trigger:

1. **Modal opens** as an overlay — the page remains in place behind a dimmed backdrop
2. **Preview** — the modal displays the share image (thumbnail), title, and description so the user sees exactly what will be shared
3. **Platform icons** — a row of SVG platform icons (see below) lets the user pick a destination
4. **Platform action** — clicking a platform icon opens the platform's share intent in a **new window/tab** (not a navigation), pre-populated with the share data
5. **Copy link** — a "Copy link" button copies the URL to the clipboard with a brief confirmation toast
6. **Web Share API** — on supported devices, show a "More options..." button inside the modal that invokes `navigator.share()`. This is an **additional** option alongside the platform icons, not a replacement or gate
7. **Close** — the modal closes on backdrop click, Escape key, or explicit close button, returning focus to the trigger element

> **Key principle:** The user never leaves the page. Platform share windows open separately. The modal is the only UI that overlays the current page. **Always show the modal** when the share trigger is clicked — never bypass it with `navigator.share()` directly, because the native share sheet on most desktop browsers lacks specific social platform options (X, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc.). The modal guarantees a consistent, platform-rich experience across all devices.

#### Share Platforms

| Platform | Share URL Pattern | Icon |
|----------|-------------------|------|
| X (Twitter) | `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text={title} — {description}&url={url}` | SVG bird/X mark |
| Facebook | `https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u={url}` | SVG "f" |
| LinkedIn | `https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url={url}` | SVG "in" |
| WhatsApp | `https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=*{title}*%0A{description}%0A{url}` | SVG phone |
| Email | `mailto:?subject={title}&body={description}%0A%0A{url}` | SVG envelope |
| Copy Link | Clipboard API with toast confirmation | SVG link/chain |
| Native Share | `navigator.share({ title, text, url })` — additional option inside modal | SVG share (OS-native) |

> **Configuration:** The set of platforms shown is project-specific. `share.js` accepts a configuration array so platforms can be added, removed, or reordered per project. At minimum, include Copy Link and one social platform.

#### SVG Icon Specifications

Share icons follow the project's Iconography Standards:

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Format | Inline SVG (not icon font, not raster) |
| Viewbox | `0 0 24 24` (consistent with Lucide or equivalent) |
| Stroke width | `2px` for share action icons; platform brand icons may use fills |
| Color | Inherits `currentColor` for share action icons; platform icons use official brand colors or monochrome per Style Guide |
| Size | `1.25rem` (inline with text/cards), `1.5rem` (standalone buttons) |
| Hover | Color transition to `--color-primary` (0.2s ease) |
| Active state | Brief scale pulse (`transform: scale(0.95)`) for tactile feedback |

The **share trigger icon** (the icon that opens the modal) should be a single, recognizable share symbol — either the standard "share" glyph (box with arrow) or a simple "nodes" icon. It must be visually distinct from social platform icons to avoid confusion between "share this" and "follow us."

#### Accessibility Requirements

* Share trigger buttons use `<button>` elements with `aria-label="Share [item title]"`
* Modal traps focus while open (per Modal/Dialog component pattern)
* Modal closes on `Escape` and returns focus to the trigger element
* Platform links have accessible names (e.g., `aria-label="Share on LinkedIn"`)
* SVG icons use `aria-hidden="true"` — the accessible name comes from the button/link
* Copy Link provides a visible confirmation (toast with `role="status"`)
* All share icons meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast against their background

#### i18n Considerations

* Modal UI text ("Share", "Copy link", "Link copied!", platform names) is translatable via `data-i18n` attributes
* Share text (title, description) uses the page's current language variant
* Share URLs use the localized page URL (e.g., `/es/servicios/` not `/services/`)
* The `{title}` and `{description}` values passed to platform URLs must be URI-encoded

### Light/Dark Theme System

Every site built with SiteCraft includes a light/dark theme toggle. This is not optional — both themes are first-class design deliverables. The theme system is **orthogonal to the Flavor System**: theme controls luminance (light vs. dark backgrounds), while Flavors control chromatic identity (brand, seasonal, contextual). Every Flavor must work in both light and dark modes.

#### Architecture Overview

The theme system uses two independent `data-*` attributes on the `<html>` element:

| Attribute | Purpose | Values | Default |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| `data-theme` | Controls light/dark mode | `"light"`, `"dark"` | `"light"` |
| `data-flavor` | Controls chromatic variation | `"[flavor-name]"` or absent for base | absent (base brand) |

These attributes are fully independent. Any combination is valid: base light, base dark, holiday-warmth light, holiday-warmth dark, etc.

#### Token Cascade

Design tokens resolve through a four-layer CSS specificity cascade:

```
Layer 1: :root { }                                         → Base light tokens (default)
Layer 2: :root[data-theme="dark"] { }                      → Dark theme overrides
Layer 3: :root[data-flavor="name"] { }                     → Flavor overrides (both themes)
Layer 4: :root[data-flavor="name"][data-theme="dark"] { }  → Flavor + dark compound
```

Each layer only overrides the tokens it needs to change. Compound selectors in Layer 4 are naturally more specific than single-attribute selectors, so no `!important` is needed. See the Style Guide template (Appendix C: Flavor System Integration) for the full CSS pattern.

#### Theme Toggle UI

The theme toggle is a persistent UI element visible on every page:

* **Position:** Header/navigation bar, typically near the language switcher
* **Control type:** A single button (not a checkbox or switch) that toggles between light and dark
* **Icon:** Sun icon for light mode, moon icon for dark mode — the icon shows the *current* theme (not the target)
* **Accessible name:** `aria-label="Switch to dark theme"` / `aria-label="Switch to light theme"` (dynamic)
* **Transition:** Smooth color transitions on theme change (`transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease` on relevant elements)

#### Persistence Strategy

`theme.js` manages theme state with the following priority:

1. **User preference** — stored in `localStorage` under the key `theme` (value: `"light"` or `"dark"`)
2. **System preference** — `prefers-color-scheme` media query (if no `localStorage` value exists)
3. **Default** — light theme (if neither of the above is available)

When the user clicks the toggle:
1. The new theme value is written to `localStorage`
2. `data-theme` on `<html>` is updated immediately
3. A custom event `site-theme-change` is dispatched with `detail: { theme: "light"|"dark" }` so other modules (analytics, Flavor system) can react

#### Anti-Flash Script

To prevent a flash of the wrong theme on page load, a small inline `<script>` in `<head>` (before any CSS) reads `localStorage` and the system preference, then sets `data-theme` on the document element synchronously. This runs before the first paint. See the HTML Template for the exact implementation.

#### CSS Implementation Notes

* `theme.css` contains: theme toggle component styles, dark-mode-specific adjustments not covered by token swaps (e.g., image brightness filters, shadow adjustments, border opacity), and the `prefers-color-scheme` media query fallback for no-JS scenarios
* `variables.css` contains the full token definitions for both light and dark themes (Layers 1 and 2 of the cascade)
* Each `flavors/[name].css` file contains both light and dark variants for that Flavor (Layers 3 and 4)

#### Image and Media Handling

* Decorative images may use `filter: brightness(0.85)` in dark mode to reduce glare
* Images with transparent backgrounds (logos, icons) must have variants or filters for both themes
* SVG icons using `currentColor` adapt automatically
* Hero images and photos should be tested for visual comfort in both themes
* Consider `<picture>` with `media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"` for critical images that need distinct dark variants

#### Accessibility Requirements

* The toggle must be keyboard-accessible and included in the tab order
* Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA in **both** themes independently
* `prefers-reduced-motion` must be respected — disable theme transition animations if the user prefers reduced motion
* `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">` is required in the HTML `<head>` so the browser renders form controls and scrollbars in the correct theme
* Focus indicators must be visible in both light and dark themes

#### i18n Considerations

* Toggle label text ("Light theme", "Dark theme") is translatable via `data-i18n`
* The `site-theme-change` event allows locale-specific adjustments if needed
* Theme preference is language-independent — switching language preserves the selected theme

#### Relationship to Flavor System

| Concern | Theme (Light/Dark) | Flavor |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **What it controls** | Luminance, background lightness, text color | Chromatic identity, accent colors, imagery, mood |
| **How many** | Exactly 2 (light and dark) | Variable per project (base + seasonal/contextual) |
| **User control** | Toggle button, always available | May be automatic (seasonal), manual, or both |
| **CSS mechanism** | `[data-theme]` attribute | `[data-flavor]` attribute |
| **Persistence** | `localStorage("theme")` | `localStorage("flavor")` or server-driven |
| **Required** | Yes — always | Yes — at least the base (default) Flavor |

> **Design rule:** When creating a new Flavor, the designer must produce the full token set for both `data-theme="light"` and `data-theme="dark"`. A Flavor is not complete until both theme variants pass WCAG contrast checks and visual review.

## DISCOVERY: STRATEGIC IDENTIFICATION

This initial stage is paramount. It's where we lay the groundwork for everything that follows. If we get this right, the subsequent stages will be much smoother and more effective.

### Traditional Activities in Discovery & Strategy

> **Cross-reference:** This section details the Discovery activities outlined in **Phase 1: Discovery** (see Workflow Architecture). The phase gates, deliverables, and exit criteria are defined there; this section provides the detailed question frameworks and methodological guidance.

This involves:

* Deep conversations with stakeholders to understand their vision, business, brand, and expectations.
* Market research: analyzing competitors, identifying target audience needs, and understanding the current landscape.
* Defining clear business objectives and how the website will serve them.
* Articulating the core message, brand values, and unique selling propositions.
* Setting initial scope and desired outcomes.

### Identifying the \[Website Project\] and \[Website Project's Owner or Brand\]

We build the foundation by answering the following topics.

#### The Website Owner

We identify specific explicit aspects as well as details that come across subtly.

* Who is the owner of this website.  
* Type of owner: Individual, team, company, organization, cooperative, community, movement, etc.  
* What is the owner's story.  
* Owner's values and beliefs.  
* Owner's style: Professional, fun, elegant, disruptive, warm, casual, family-friendly, bold, etc.

#### The Website's Goal and Nature

* Primary goal(s) of the website: Conversion, information, support, visibility, trust-building, positioning, education, etc.  
* What should the website accomplish for its owner: Generate leads, present work, establish credibility, act as knowledge hub, etc.  
* What should the website accomplish for its audience: Answers, solutions, confidence, education, support, action triggers, etc.

### Identifying the \[Target Audience\]

* Who are the intended audiences and what roles do they play: Clients, potential clients, partners, job seekers, media, internal users, investors, etc.  
* The target audience's priorities and interests.  
* What matters most to them.  
* What they need or hope to find.  
* What they would appreciate finding.

### Identifying the Style, Story & Creative Identity

* Preferred communication tone: Casual, sophisticated, assertive, emotional, intellectual, minimalist, etc.  
* Preferred visual aesthetic and inspirations: "modern zen", "vintage print press", "neo-gothic", "organic/nature", "street-smart minimalism", etc.  
* Any Flavor to use as the central metaphor or style: A forest? A gallery? A jungle? A dream? A factory? A backstage room? A street market? A library? A marketplace? A streaming website? A theme park? A hotel lobby? A corporate reception area? A news program? An investigative report program? etc.

### Discovery Brief — Output Format

The Discovery phase should produce a structured **Discovery Brief** capturing findings from the above topics. This is the Phase 1 exit deliverable referenced by all Conceptualization prompts.

| Section | Contents | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Website Owner Profile | Owner type, story, values, style | Stakeholder interviews |
| Website Goal & Nature | Primary goals, owner objectives, audience objectives | Stakeholder interviews |
| Target Audience (Initial) | Identified segments, priorities, expectations | Research + stakeholder input |
| Competitive Landscape | Key competitors, positioning gaps, opportunities | Market research |
| Style & Creative Direction (Initial) | Preferred tone, aesthetic, metaphor/Flavor concepts | Stakeholder interviews |
| Open Questions & Risks | Unresolved items, areas requiring further research | All sources |

> **Relationship to Phase 1 exit deliverables:** This brief consolidates the Discovery findings into a single document. It is distinct from the Stakeholder Interview Summaries and Competitive Analysis (which are supporting artifacts) and serves as the primary handoff to the Conceptualization phase.

## CONCEPTUALIZATION: FOUNDATIONAL DEFINITION

### Enhanced Prompt Template Structure

All prompts in Xperto SiteCraft follow this standardized structure to ensure consistency, quality, and effective handoffs between experts.

```
## [ROLE]: [Role Name]
## [PHASE]: [Conceptualization/Design/Execution]
## [TASK]: [Task Name]

### CONTEXT
You are working on [Website Project] for [Website Project's Owner or Brand].

### INPUTS
* [Input 1 from specific previous role/task]
* [Input 2 from specific previous role/task]

### OBJECTIVE
[Clear statement of what this task must accomplish]

### CONSTRAINTS
* DO: [Specific inclusions]
* DO NOT: [Specific exclusions]
* ASK IF UNCLEAR: [Areas where clarification should be requested]

### OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
Produce the following in [FORMAT]:
1. [Deliverable 1] — [brief description]
2. [Deliverable 2] — [brief description]

### QUALITY CRITERIA
Your output will be evaluated on:
* [ ] Alignment with [specific input]
* [ ] Completeness of [specific element]
* [ ] Clarity for [downstream consumer role]

### HANDOFF
This output will be used by [Next Role] for [Purpose].
```

### Collaborative Task Protocol

Several prompts assign two roles (e.g., "Brand Strategist + Communications Expert"). When a task is collaborative, the following protocol applies:

* **Lead role:** The first role listed owns the deliverable, drives the timeline, and makes final decisions on structure and content.
* **Review role:** The second role listed provides domain-specific input, reviews drafts, and validates outputs within their area of expertise.
* **Process:**
  1. Lead role produces initial draft
  2. Review role provides written feedback within one working cycle
  3. Lead role integrates feedback and produces revised draft
  4. If disagreements remain, both roles document their positions and the Project Manager arbitrates based on project goals and Brand DNA alignment
* **Attribution:** Collaborative deliverables credit both roles: "Produced by [Lead Role] with [Review Role]."
* **Escalation:** If the collaboration produces conflicting outputs, the Project Manager resolves based on which output best serves the project's strategic objectives (as defined in Brand DNA and Website Goals).

### Defining \[Site Persona\] — Persona-Driven Architecture (Optional)

#### Goal

To determine whether the website benefits from a character-host persona that serves as the site's narrative voice, and if so, to fully define that persona as an organizing principle for content, navigation, and interaction.

Not every site needs a persona. A corporate site may speak as the brand. But sites focused on education, curation, community, or ongoing content often benefit enormously from a defined character — a host, curator, or guide — that creates narrative coherence, builds trust through personality, and makes the site feel like a curated experience rather than a collection of pages.

#### When to Use a Site Persona

| Indicator | Persona Recommended | Persona Not Needed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Content model | Curated, editorial, educational | Transactional, catalog, corporate |
| Relationship with audience | Ongoing, trust-based | One-time, functional |
| Voice consistency | Needs a distinctive, recognizable voice | Brand voice sufficient |
| Interactive features | Chatbot, guided tours, commentary | Standard navigation |
| Content tone | Opinionated, warm, conversational | Neutral, institutional |

* DO: Make the persona relatable to the target audience
* DO: Define how the persona adapts across languages and cultures
* DO: Specify where and how the persona appears on the site
* DO NOT: Create a gimmick — the persona must add genuine value
* DO NOT: Let the persona overshadow the content or the brand itself
* DO NOT: Make the persona so specific that it alienates audience segments
* ASK IF UNCLEAR: How prominent the persona should be, how interactive

### OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

* Avatar specifications for different placements (navigation, chat, content, hero)
* Emotional range: visual variations for different content moods
* Accessibility requirements:
  * Screen reader: how the persona is conveyed via alt text, ARIA labels, and live region announcements
  * Keyboard navigation: all persona-driven interactive elements (chat, guided tours) must be fully keyboard-accessible
  * Chatbot a11y: chatbot interactions must support screen readers, provide text alternatives for visual responses, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
  * Non-visual fallback: define how persona value is delivered when visual representation is unavailable

#### 5. Site Presence Map
Where and how the persona appears:

| Touchpoint | Presence Type | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| Homepage hero | Full introduction | Welcome message, avatar |
| Section introductions | Brief commentary | "Here's what I recommend..." |
| Article headers | Byline/attribution | "Curated by [Persona]" |

## DESIGN

### Creativity and Uniqueness Philosophy

The structure of our workflow and process does not kill creativity—it unleashes it and releases a unique and original website as a result.

We visualize themes, concepts, or allegories to style and build the website around. This influences the types and topics of images, the coloring, and the style of the text.

**Principle:** A website about health does not have to look medical. A law firm doesn't have to look like every other law firm. A children's brand doesn't have to use primary colors.

We visualize and offer suggestions for unique, creative, and effective types of content and interactions for differentiation and impact.

### Visual Design System

#### Goal

To create a comprehensive, implementation-ready design system that translates the Creative Direction into systematic visual rules, components, and patterns. This is the bridge between creative vision and code — every design decision here must be specific enough for a developer to implement without ambiguity.

#### Prompt

```
## [ROLE]: Visual Design Expert
## [PHASE]: Design
## [TASK]: Create Visual Design System

### CONTEXT
You are working on [Website Project] for [Website Project's Owner or Brand].

### OBJECTIVE
Create a complete Visual Design System that defines every visual element of the website — from atomic design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) through molecular components (buttons, cards, forms) to organism-level patterns (headers, page layouts, navigation). This system must be internally consistent, accessible, implementation-ready, and extensible for the Flavor System.

### CONSTRAINTS
* DO: Define every visual decision as a design token or reusable pattern

```

### The Flavor System

We have developed the concept of "Flavors" as a way to customize the presentation of the brand while respecting its corporate and visual guidelines to optimize your communication impact. This allows us to create really creative and unique pages.

Flavors are thematic visual variations that can be applied to your website to adapt to seasons, special occasions, audience segments or specific moods while maintaining brand consistency and without affecting the content.

#### Flavor Architecture Framework

##### Flavor Layers

1. **Chromatic Layer** — Color palette variations  
2. **Typographic Layer** — Font weight/style adjustments (within brand fonts)  
3. **Imagery Layer** — Photography/illustration style shifts  
4. **Motion Layer** — Animation character changes  
5. **Tonal Layer** — Copy micro-adjustments

##### Flavor Types

They can be as diverse and specific as Independence Day, Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Urban Explorer, Digital Scribe, Future Forward, Artisanal Roots, Tranquil Haven

| Type | Trigger | Duration | Scope | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Seasonal** | Calendar | Weeks-months | Site-wide | Summer, Winter, Spring |
| **Event-based** | Specific date | Days-weeks | Site-wide or section | Black Friday, Product Launch |
| **Cultural** | Regional/cultural moments | Variable | Localized or site-wide | Lunar New Year, Carnival |
| **Contextual** | User segment | Persistent | Personalized | Executive version, Youth version |
| **Promotional** | Campaign | Campaign duration | Landing pages | Sale, Special Offer |
| **Thematic** | Brand expression | Ongoing | Alternative site version | Playful vs. Professional |

##### Flavor Inheritance Rules

* **Base Flavor:** Default brand expression (always defined)  
* **Overlay Flavors:** Additive modifications to Base (stackable)  
* **Override Flavors:** Complete replacement for specific contexts

#### Contextual Flavor Library

Beyond seasonal Flavors, the system includes Flavors for specific audiences, regions, and contexts.

> **Workflow integration:** The Contextual Flavor Library is produced by the Visual Design Expert as part of the Flavor System Specifications deliverable. Entries are validated by the Creative Designer for brand alignment and the Accessibility Expert for per-variant compliance. Each selected Flavor feeds into the Flavor System prompt above — the library provides the palette of options; the prompt structures their implementation.

##### Regional Flavors

> **Customization required:** The following are starting-point examples to illustrate the concept of regional Flavors. They are intentionally broad and must be refined, replaced, or expanded for each project based on actual target markets, local research, and cultural expert input. Treating these as ready-made library items risks inappropriate cultural generalizations.

### Learning Path Architecture (For Sites with Educational Goals)

#### Goal

To define structured, progressive learning experiences when a website includes educational content — courses, tutorials, certification paths, or onboarding sequences. This goes beyond standard content architecture by introducing progression logic, competency tracking, and audience-adaptive pathways.

Not every site needs this. Use this module when the website's goals include education, training, upskilling, or guided onboarding.

#### When to Use Learning Path Architecture

| Indicator | Learning Paths Needed | Standard Content Sufficient |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Content builds sequentially | Concepts require prior knowledge | Each piece stands alone |
| Audience skill levels vary widely | Beginners and experts visit the same site | Audience is relatively homogeneous |
| Completion matters | Users benefit from finishing a sequence | Users consume what they need |
| Credentials or progress tracking | Certificates, badges, or progress bars add value | No tracking needed |
| Role-based content | Different audiences need different paths through similar material | One path fits all |

#### Prompt

```
## [ROLE]: Content Strategist + UX Expert (collaborative)
## [PHASE]: Design
## [TASK]: Define Learning Path Architecture

### CONTEXT
You are working on [Website Project] for [Website Project's Owner or Brand].
The website includes educational content that benefits from structured learning paths.

### INPUTS
* Content Architecture Document

### CONSTRAINTS
* DO: Design paths that can be followed sequentially OR accessed independently
* DO: Support multiple entry points based on prior knowledge
* DO: Include assessment or self-assessment mechanisms
* DO: Make progress visible and motivating
* DO NOT: Create rigid paths that prevent exploration
* DO NOT: Gate content unnecessarily — prefer encouraging progression over forcing it
* DO NOT: Assume all users will complete full paths
* ASK IF UNCLEAR: Whether certification, CLE credits, or formal credentials are goals

### OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
Produce a "Learning Architecture Document" containing:

#### 1. Learning Goals Alignment
* How learning paths serve the website's primary goals
* What learners should be able to DO after completing each path

| Prerequisite knowledge | What learners should know before starting |
| Learning objectives | Specific, measurable outcomes |
| Estimated duration | Total time commitment |
| Modules/Lessons | Ordered sequence with descriptions |
| Assessment method | How progress/mastery is measured |
| Completion criteria | What constitutes "done" |
| Credential (if any) | Badge, certificate, or recognition |

* Module title and description
* Learning objectives (2-3 per module)
* Content format mix (text, interactive, video, exercise, quiz)
* Estimated time to complete
* Key concepts introduced
* Practical exercises or activities
* Self-check assessment
* Links to related site content (prompts, tools, articles)
* "You'll know you've mastered this when..." statement

#### 4. Audience-Adaptive Tracks
* How the same core content is framed differently for different personas
* Entry point recommendations per persona
* Skip/accelerate options for experienced users
* Supplementary content per track (role-specific examples, exercises)

#### 5. Difficulty Progression Framework
* How difficulty levels are defined (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced — or custom scale)
* What distinguishes each level in terms of content complexity, assumed knowledge, and expected outputs
* How the interface communicates difficulty to users
* Progression indicators and encouragement mechanics

#### 6. Progress Tracking Design
* What is tracked: module completion, quiz scores, time spent, bookmarks
* Storage: cookie/localStorage (anonymous) vs. account-based (authenticated)
* Visual representation: progress bars, checkmarks, path visualization
* "Continue where you left off" functionality
* Shareable progress (optional): "I've completed X% of this path"

#### 7. Assessment & Self-Assessment
* Quiz/check types: multiple choice, scenario-based, practical exercise
* Scoring and feedback approach
* Remediation: what happens when a learner struggles
* Optional vs. required assessments

#### 8. Integration with Site Content
* How learning paths link to other site sections (articles, tools, resources)
* How standalone articles/content link back into learning paths ("This topic is covered in Module 3 of [Path]")
* How new content is evaluated for inclusion in existing paths

### QUALITY CRITERIA
* [ ] Paths are achievable and realistically scoped
* [ ] Multiple audience tracks are genuinely differentiated
* [ ] Progress tracking is privacy-respecting and technically feasible

### Interactive Utility Tools & Calculators

#### Goal

To define interactive tools that provide standalone, immediate value to users — calculators, assessors, builders, and simulators that go beyond passive content. These are distinct from standard UI components: they accept user input, process it, and produce a personalized, useful output.

Utility tools are high-engagement content assets. They drive return visits, generate shareable results, and provide data about user needs. They should be treated as first-class content types with the same strategic rigor as articles or pages.

#### Utility Tool Types

| Type | Description | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Calculator** | Takes numeric/categorical inputs, produces quantified output | ROI calculator, time savings estimator, cost comparison |
| **Assessment** | Asks diagnostic questions, produces a scored evaluation | Readiness assessment, maturity model, skills gap analysis |
| **Builder/Generator** | Guides user through steps to create a personalized artifact | Template builder, prompt constructor, plan generator |
| **Simulator** | Presents scenarios with branching outcomes | Decision tree, "what would happen if..." explorer |
| **Comparison** | Takes two+ inputs and produces an analyzed comparison | Side-by-side analyzer, before/after evaluator |
| **Finder/Recommender** | Filters a dataset based on user criteria | Tool finder, resource matcher, path recommender |

#### Prompt

```

## COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE

### Goal

To define how a website incorporates community participation — user-generated content, contributions, ratings, feedback, and collaborative content creation — when the site's goals benefit from community involvement.

Not every site needs community features. But sites that curate resources, serve professional communities, host libraries of reusable content, or aim to build an ongoing relationship with their audience can derive enormous value from structured community engagement.

### When to Use Community Architecture

| Indicator | Community Features Recommended | Not Needed |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Content type | Libraries, directories, templates, recipes, prompts | Static pages, brochures |
| Audience relationship | Ongoing, professional community | One-time visitors |
| Content volume goals | Needs to scale beyond editorial capacity | Editorial team can maintain |
| Trust model | Peer recommendations add value | Authority-only content |
| Engagement goals | Return visits, loyalty, advocacy | Conversion and exit |

### Community Engagement Models

| Model | Description | Moderation Level | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Contribution** | Users submit new content (articles, prompts, templates, reviews) | High — editorial review before publication | Prompt library submissions |
| **Enhancement** | Users improve existing content (suggestions, corrections, additions) | Medium — flagged for editorial review | "Suggest an improvement" links |
| **Rating & Review** | Users rate and review existing content | Low — automated filters + periodic review | Star ratings, helpfulness votes |
| **Discussion** | Users discuss content with each other | Medium-High — moderation required | Comment threads, forums |
| **Curation** | Users create collections or lists from existing content | Low — private by default, moderated if shared | "My favorites" lists |

### Prompt

#### 4. Moderation Framework
* Moderation policy: what is and isn't acceptable
* Moderation tools and workflows
* Response time commitments
* Escalation paths

* What can be rated (content, tools, resources)
* Rating mechanism (stars, thumbs, helpfulness vote)
* How ratings are displayed and aggregated
* Anti-gaming measures (rate limiting, verified interactions)
* How ratings influence content visibility or ordering

#### 6. Contributor Recognition
* How contributors are acknowledged (byline, profile, leaderboard, badge)
* Contribution tiers (if applicable)
* Incentive structures (recognition, access, features)
* Privacy options: anonymous contribution vs. credited

#### 7. Integration with Editorial Content
* How community content coexists with editorial content

## AI-POWERED FEATURES

### Goal

To define patterns for integrating artificial intelligence as a functional feature of the website itself — not just as a tool used during development, but as a live, user-facing capability that enhances the site experience.

AI-powered features can transform a static content site into an intelligent, responsive platform. When implemented thoughtfully, they add significant value. When implemented poorly, they erode trust. This section provides the framework for getting it right.

### AI Feature Types

| Feature Type | Description | Complexity | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Conversational AI / Chatbot** | An interactive assistant that answers questions, guides users, and provides personalized help using the site's content as a knowledge base | High | "Ask [Persona]" — AI chat embodying the site's character |
| **Content Recommendation Engine** | Suggests relevant content based on user behavior, preferences, or current context | Medium | "You might also like..." / "Related articles" |
| **Intelligent Search** | AI-enhanced search that understands intent, handles synonyms, and provides contextual results beyond keyword matching | Medium | Natural language search: "How do I get started?" |
| **Personalized Content Adaptation** | Dynamically adjusts content presentation, emphasis, or examples based on user profile or behavior | Medium-High | Practice-area-specific examples surfaced for returning users |
| **AI-Assisted Interactive Tools** | Tools that use AI to process user input and generate sophisticated, personalized outputs | High | Roadmap builder, prompt optimizer, document analyzer |
| **Content Summarization** | On-demand AI summaries of long-form content | Low-Medium | "Give me the 2-minute version" button on articles |

### Prompt

2. **Assess** — Project Manager evaluates impact on timeline, budget, and deliverables
3. **Document** — Produce a Scope Change Request containing:
   * Description of requested change
   * Affected deliverables and phases
   * Estimated additional time and cost
   * Risks of including vs. deferring
   * Recommendation (include now, defer to post-launch, or decline with rationale)
4. **Approve** — Client signs off on the Scope Change Request before work begins
5. **Integrate** — Update project timeline, resource allocation, and relevant phase deliverables

> **Guideline:** Minor clarifications and refinements within existing deliverables are not scope changes. New deliverables, additional pages, new features, or changes that alter previously approved direction are scope changes.

#### Conflict Resolution Framework

When disagreements arise between the project team and the client:

1. **Clarify** — Ensure both parties understand each other's position and the underlying concern
2. **Reference** — Ground the discussion in project artifacts (Brand DNA, Goals, Personas) to provide objective criteria
3. **Explore** — Present alternative solutions that address the client's concern while preserving strategic integrity
4. **Escalate** — If unresolved, the Project Manager escalates to the project sponsor or executive stakeholder
5. **Document** — Record the decision, rationale, and any trade-offs in the Phase Completion Summary

--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
--shadow-glow: 0 0 40px rgba(X, X, X, 0.15);
```

### Border Styling

| State | Style | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Default | `1px solid rgba(X, X, X, 0.1)` | Subtle borders |
| Hover | `1px solid rgba(X, X, X, 0.3)` | More visible on interaction |
| Active | `1px solid var(--color-primary)` | Full color when active |

### Design Tokens

Design tokens are platform-agnostic design decisions expressed as key-value pairs. They serve as the single source of truth for design values, enabling consistent implementation across web, native, and documentation.

#### Token Methodology

Tokens follow a three-tier hierarchy, with theme and Flavor as orthogonal override dimensions:

| Tier | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Global** | Raw values with no semantic meaning | `--blue-500: #3B82F6` |
| **Semantic** | Purpose-driven aliases of global tokens | `--color-primary: var(--blue-500)` |
| **Component** | Component-specific overrides of semantic tokens | `--button-bg: var(--color-primary)` |

Override dimensions (applied independently):

| Dimension | Mechanism | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Theme** | `[data-theme="dark"]` on `:root` | `--color-bg` changes from white to dark |
| **Flavor** | `[data-flavor="name"]` on `:root` | `--color-primary` shifts to seasonal palette |
| **Theme + Flavor** | Compound selector `[data-flavor][data-theme]` | Flavor's dark-specific adjustments |

#### Naming Conventions

```
--{category}-{property}-{variant}-{state}

Examples:
--color-text-primary
--color-text-primary-hover
--spacing-section-lg
--font-size-heading-h1
--shadow-card-hover
--border-radius-sm
```

#### Platform-Agnostic Format

Tokens should be maintained in a format that can generate platform-specific outputs:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "primary": { "value": "#XXXXXX", "type": "color" },
    "primary-dark": { "value": "#XXXXXX", "type": "color" }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "section": { "value": "3rem", "type": "dimension" },
    "component": { "value": "1.5rem", "type": "dimension" }
  },
  "font": {
    "family-heading": { "value": "'[Font Name]', serif", "type": "fontFamily" },
    "size-h1": { "value": "clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3rem)", "type": "dimension" }
  }
}
```

> **Implementation:** Use tools like Style Dictionary, Tokens Studio, or a custom build step to transform tokens into CSS custom properties, SCSS variables, or other platform formats.

### Typography

#### Font Families

| Type | Font | Weights | Fallback |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Headings | `'[Font Name]', serif` | 400, 600, 700 | Georgia, serif |
| Body | `'[Font Name]', sans-serif` | 300, 400, 500, 600 | Arial, sans-serif |
| Monospace | `'[Font Name]', monospace` | 400 | Courier, monospace |

#### Font Sizes

| Element | Size | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| H1 (Hero) | `clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3rem)` | Responsive scaling |
| H2 (Section) | `1.8rem` | Section headers |
| H3 (Subsection) | `1.4rem` | Subsection headers |
| H4 (Card title) | `1.2rem` | Card headers |
| Body text | `1.05rem` | Main content |
| Small text | `0.85rem - 0.95rem` | Footers, captions |
| Badge text | `0.85rem` | Uppercase, letter-spacing: 1px |

#### Line Heights

| Element | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Headings | `1.2` |
| Body text | `1.6 - 1.8` |
| Tight (labels) | `1.4` |

```
> **Accessibility:** Modal traps focus, closes on Escape, returns focus to trigger. Platform links open in new tabs (`target="_blank" rel="noopener"`). Copy confirmation uses `role="status"`.

#### Theme Toggle

```css
.theme-toggle {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 2.5rem;
    height: 2.5rem;

    transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease, border-color 0.3s ease;
}

.theme-toggle:hover {
    background: var(--color-primary);
    color: var(--color-bg);
    border-color: var(--color-primary);
}

    outline: 2px solid var(--color-primary);
    outline-offset: 2px;
}

.theme-toggle__icon {
    width: 1.25rem;
    height: 1.25rem;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.theme-toggle:hover .theme-toggle__icon {
    transform: rotate(15deg);
}

/* Icon visibility: show sun in light mode, moon in dark mode */
.theme-toggle__icon--sun  { display: block; }
.theme-toggle__icon--moon { display: none; }

:root[data-theme="dark"] .theme-toggle__icon--sun  { display: none; }
:root[data-theme="dark"] .theme-toggle__icon--moon { display: block; }

/* Respect reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    .theme-toggle,
    .theme-toggle__icon {
        transition: none;
    }
}
```

```html
<button class="theme-toggle" aria-label="Switch to dark theme">
    <svg class="theme-toggle__icon theme-toggle__icon--sun" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <!-- Sun icon (Lucide or custom) -->
    </svg>
    <svg class="theme-toggle__icon theme-toggle__icon--moon" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <!-- Moon icon (Lucide or custom) -->
    </svg>
</button>
```

> **Behavior:** `theme.js` toggles `data-theme` on `<html>`, persists to `localStorage`, and updates `aria-label` dynamically ("Switch to dark theme" / "Switch to light theme"). Icon swap is handled purely via CSS. See Light/Dark Theme System (Website Structure) for full architecture.

### Layout Patterns

#### Container Widths

| Type | Value | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Content | `max-width: 900px` | Main content areas |
| Wide | `max-width: 1200px` | Full-width sections |
| Narrow | `max-width: 600px` | Forms, focused content |

#### Section Spacing

| Context | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Between sections | `margin-bottom: 3rem` |
| Section padding | `padding: 2rem` |
| Mobile padding | `padding: 1rem` |

#### Grid Layouts

```css
/* Auto-fit responsive grid */
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
    gap: 1.5rem;
}

/* Fixed column grid */
.grid-3 {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 1.5rem;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .grid-3 {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
```

#### Header Structure

| Property | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Position | `fixed` |
| Z-index | `100` |
| Bottom border | `1px solid rgba(X, X, X, 0.2)` |
| Desktop padding | `1rem 2rem` |
| Mobile padding | `1rem` |

### Animation & Transitions

#### Standard Transition

```css
transition: all 0.3s ease;
```

#### Hover Effects

| Element | Effect |
| :---- | :---- |
| Links | Color change to primary/accent |
| Cards | `translateY(-2px)` or `translateY(-4px)` |
| Buttons | Lift \+ glow shadow |
| Images | Optional scale or opacity change |

#### Timing Functions

| Type | Value | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Standard | `ease` | General transitions |
| Smooth | `ease-in-out` | Enter/exit animations |
| Bounce | `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)` | Playful interactions |

### Iconography

#### Icon Style

| Attribute | Specification |
| :---- | :---- |
| Type | \[SVG / Emoji / Icon font\] |
| Default size | `1.5rem - 2.5rem` |
| Color | Inherits from text or uses `--color-primary` |
| Stroke width | `2px` (if using stroke-based icons) |

#### Icon Placement

| Context | Placement |
| :---- | :---- |
| Section headers | Before title with `gap: 0.75rem` |
| Cards | Above title, centered |
| Buttons | Before or after text with `gap: 0.5rem` |
| Lists | Before list item |

### Responsive Design

#### Breakpoint Behavior Map

| Breakpoint | Width | Layout Changes |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `xs` | 0–639px | Single column, hamburger nav, stacked cards, minimal padding, vertically stacked footer |
| `sm` | 640–767px | Single column with wider cards, slightly increased padding |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Two-column grids, tablet nav (may still use hamburger), side-by-side cards |
| `lg` | 1024–1279px | Full desktop nav, three-column grids, sidebar layouts enabled |
| `xl` | 1280–1535px | Max-width containers, comfortable spacing, full component display |
| `2xl` | 1536px+ | Wide layouts, increased max-widths, large-screen typography scaling |

#### Media Query Examples

```css
/* xs: base styles — no media query */
.grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
.site-nav .nav-links { display: none; }
.site-nav .hamburger { display: block; }

/* sm: large phones */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
    .card { min-width: 280px; }
}

/* md: tablets */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }
    .footer-links { flex-direction: row; }
}

/* lg: small laptops — full nav */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .site-nav .nav-links { display: flex; }
    .site-nav .hamburger { display: none; }
    .grid-3 { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); }
}

/* xl: desktops */
@media (min-width: 1280px) {
    .container { max-width: 1200px; }
}

#### Color Contrast

| Combination | Ratio | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Text on background | X.X:1 | \[Pass/Fail\] |
| Primary on background | X.X:1 | \[Pass/Fail\] |
| Muted text on background | X.X:1 | \[Pass/Fail\] |

#### Focus States

```css
:focus {
    outline: 2px solid var(--color-primary);
    outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### Flavor System Integration

This section documents how the Flavor System overrides the base Style Guide tokens.

#### Token Override Mapping

Each Flavor overrides a subset of the base design tokens. Document overrides using this format:

| Base Token | Base Value | Flavor Override | Flavor Value |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `--color-primary` | `#XXXXXX` | Holiday Warmth | `#XXXXXX` |
| `--color-bg` | `#XXXXXX` | Holiday Warmth | `#XXXXXX` |
| `--font-family-heading` | `'[Font]'` | Holiday Warmth | `'[Alt Font]'` |

#### Theme × Flavor Token Layering

Theme (light/dark) and Flavor are independent dimensions. The token cascade is:

```
Base Light → Theme override (dark) → Flavor override → Flavor + Theme override
```

Every Flavor must define both light and dark variants. The combination is resolved via two `data-*` attributes on `<html>`: `data-theme` and `data-flavor`.

#### CSS Custom Property Pattern

```css
/* ── Layer 1: Base Light tokens (default) ── */
:root {
    --color-primary: #XXXXXX;
    --color-bg: #FFFFFF;
    --color-text: #1A1A1A;
    --color-bg-card: #F5F5F5;
    --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    --animation-duration: 0.3s;
}

/* ── Layer 2: Dark theme override ── */
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
    --color-bg: #121212;
    --color-text: #E0E0E0;
    --color-bg-card: #1E1E1E;
    --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
}

/* ── Layer 3: Flavor override (applies to both themes) ── */
:root[data-flavor="holiday-warmth"] {
    --color-primary: #C62828;
    --animation-duration: 0.4s;
}

/* ── Layer 4: Flavor + Dark theme compound override ── */
:root[data-flavor="holiday-warmth"][data-theme="dark"] {
    --color-primary: #EF5350;
    --color-bg: #1B0000;
    --color-bg-card: #2C0A0A;
}

/* ── System preference fallback (before JS loads) ── */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    :root:not([data-theme]) {
        --color-bg: #121212;
        --color-text: #E0E0E0;
        --color-bg-card: #1E1E1E;
        --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    }
}

/* ── Reduced-motion override (all combinations) ── */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    :root {
        --animation-duration: 0s;
    }
}
```

> **Specificity note:** Compound selectors (`[data-flavor][data-theme="dark"]`) are more specific than single-attribute selectors, so Layer 4 naturally overrides Layers 2 and 3 without `!important`.

#### Variant Documentation Format

For each Flavor variant, document:

1. **Flavor name** and activation trigger (seasonal, demographic, manual)
2. **Light mode token overrides** — complete list of tokens changed from base light
3. **Dark mode token overrides** — complete list of tokens changed from base dark
4. **New assets** — any images, icons, or patterns specific to the Flavor (note if light/dark variants needed)
5. **Contrast verification** — WCAG AA status for all text/background combinations in **both** light and dark modes
6. **Animation changes** — any motion differences with reduced-motion fallbacks
7. **Preview** — screenshots or staging links for **both** light and dark versions of the Flavor
