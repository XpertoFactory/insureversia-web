## Generation Notes

### Recommended Settings

**Google Gemini Imagen 3:**
- Use "Natural" or "Photography" style mode
- Set aspect ratio to 16:9 for hero images, 1.91:1 for OG image
- Generate at highest resolution available
- May need 3-5 generations per prompt to get the best result

**MidJourney:**
- Use `--style raw` for less stylized, more editorial results
- `--s 200` for moderate stylization
- `--v 6.1` for latest model
- Use `--ar 16:9` for hero images, `--ar 1.91:1` for OG image
- Upscale the best result with `U1`-`U4`

### Post-Processing

1. **Hero images:** Export at 1920x1080px minimum. These display behind CSS gradient overlays (`rgba(27,42,74,0.82)` or similar), so the image should be visible but subdued. Test with the actual gradient overlay before finalizing.
2. **OG image:** Export at exactly 1200x630px. This displays as-is on social platforms without any overlay — it must look complete and branded on its own.
3. **File format:** PNG for all images. Optimize with a tool like TinyPNG to keep file sizes under 300KB for hero images and under 200KB for the OG image.
4. **Consistency:** Generate all hero images in the same session/style to maintain visual cohesion across the site.
