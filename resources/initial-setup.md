Let's create a website on AI for the Insurance industry
insureversia.com

Follow the Xperto Sitecraft model (/resources/xperto-sitecraft.md) for the website.

Curator is Carlos Miranda Levy. He's personal profile page is https://thesocialentrepreneur.com. You can see how he is referenced in our similar sites https://100.cemi.ai/about and https://lawra.org/about

# REFERENCE
We have done a similar project for AI in Legal Practice. You can see it at https://lawra.org
I have copied all of its files and structure in /reference/lawra
Feel free to explore it and use it as a reference and even lift code from it.

# FUNNEL
All pages should be part of a funnel that leads to the AI Learning Program.
All pages should have a clear CTA to the AI Learning Program. (Ready to learn more? or similar), in addition to other relevant links so it does not feel too pushy: for example links to the Prompt Library, Prompt Builder, AI Readiness Assessment, AI Help Calculator, AI Adoption Roadmap, Install a Local AI, etc. But always with the AI Learning Program as the main CTA.

# CONTENT
We want to include multiple sections (feel free to add more if you think it's needed) to the website:

All sections and examples should cover the "SECTORS TO CONSIDER AND COVER" listed at the end of this document.

# AI LEARNING PROGRAM
Create a learning program for AI in Insurance Practice.
Create the program outline, structure and content.

Let's keep the presentation effective and concise and engaging and easy to read and understand and not overwhelm the user.
We want this to be a funnel to convert into them signing up for the program.

This program should be offered at the end of all the assessments, calculators, roadmaps, etc. with a motivating CTA like "Ready to take the next step?" or "Ready to become AI-ready?" or "Ready to become AI-proficient?" or "Ready to become AI-masterful?".

## Methodology
Based on our unique Smoother methodology for effective learning.

## Length
It comes in 4 formats: 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours.

## Approach and Style
It's hands-on practical use of AI in Insurance practice. 
It includes customized case studies, Role simulations and Scenarios.

### Personalization
Content and activities are tailored to each participant. Taking into consideration each participants learning style, learning speed and level of skills and competencies.
It all starts with a fast (lengthy and detailed initial assessments are available too if so desired)but scientific assessment of the participant and based on it, we provide a learning path, learning activities and learning content, tools and environment suited to the participant.  
They all include customized case studies, role simulations and scenarios.

## Format
Our programs are available in 18 different formats, from micro-learning to intensive bootcamps and long-term coaching and mentoring programs. 
They are available as self-learning, coached-learning (advice and guidance) and in-person tutoring (real time, virtual or in-person).
