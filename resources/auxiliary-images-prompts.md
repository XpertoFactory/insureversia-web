### Gemini Prompt

```
Design a modern, elegant logo for "Insureversia", an educational platform about artificial intelligence in the insurance industry.

The logo should feature a stylized shield shape that subtly incorporates a neural network or circuit pattern, representing the fusion of insurance (protection, trust) and AI (intelligence, innovation). The shield should feel modern and minimal — not corporate or heavy.

Inside or overlapping the shield, include a clean, geometric lettermark "I" that feels both authoritative and technological.

Color palette: deep navy (#0F2B46) as the primary color, warm gold (#C9A84C) as an accent for key details, and a touch of bright teal (#00B4D8) for a node or connection point that adds energy.

Style: flat design, vector-quality, minimal detail, suitable for use as a favicon at 32px and as a header logo at 200px wide. Clean lines, no gradients, no photorealism. The overall feel should be sophisticated and trustworthy, like a premium fintech brand — not playful or cartoonish.

White or transparent background. No tagline text, just the logomark and the word "Insureversia" in a clean serif typeface beside or below it.
```

### Variations to try

1. **Icon only** — Same prompt but end with: "Logomark only, no text. Square aspect ratio, suitable for app icon and favicon."
2. **Horizontal lockup** — Same prompt but specify: "Horizontal layout with logomark on the left and 'Insureversia' text to the right. Wide aspect ratio (3:1)."
3. **Dark background version** — Append: "Place on a dark navy (#0F2B46) background, using white and gold for the logo elements."

### I. Seed / Growth & Assured Future

```
Design a modern, elegant logo for "Insureversia", an educational platform about artificial intelligence in the insurance industry.

The logomark should be an abstract seed or sprout form — a compact, rounded base with a single upward element emerging from it, suggesting growth, potential, and an assured future. The seed shape should contain a minimal circuit or dot-and-line pattern inside, representing AI intelligence embedded within something organic and full of promise. Insurance is about planting certainty so the future can grow.

The overall silhouette should be simple enough to read at small sizes. The lettermark "I" can be formed by the sprouting vertical element.
