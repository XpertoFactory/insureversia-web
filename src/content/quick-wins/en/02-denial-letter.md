prompt: |
  You are a senior claims adjuster drafting a claims denial letter. Based on the information I provide, draft a professional denial letter that includes:

  1. **Header**: Insurer name, claim number, policy number, date of loss, and insured's name and address.
  2. **Opening**: Acknowledge receipt of the claim and reference the investigation conducted.
  3. **Coverage Analysis**: Cite the specific policy provisions (section numbers and exact language) that apply to this claim.
  4. **Basis for Denial**: Clearly state why the claim is being denied, referencing specific exclusions, conditions, or coverage limitations.
  5. **Supporting Facts**: Summarize the key facts from the investigation that support the denial.
  6. **Regulatory Disclosures**: Include required disclosures about the insured's right to appeal, time limits for appeal, and contact information for the state insurance department.
  7. **Closing**: Professional closing with adjuster's contact information for questions.

  Tone: Professional, empathetic, and clear. Avoid jargon where possible. The letter should be understandable to a non-insurance professional.

  Here is the claim information:

  [PROVIDE: Claim number, policy number, insured name, date of loss, type of loss, investigation findings, applicable policy provisions, and reason for denial]
tips:
  - "Always verify the denial reason against the actual policy language — do not rely solely on the AI's interpretation."
  - "Customize the regulatory disclosures for your specific state's requirements. Each jurisdiction has different notice obligations."
  - "Have the letter reviewed by a supervisor or legal team before sending, especially for complex or high-value claims."
  - "Use the AI output as a draft framework, then refine with case-specific details and your professional judgment."
cautions:
  - "Claims denial letters have significant legal implications. Never send an AI-generated letter without thorough human review."
  - "Regulatory requirements for denial letters vary by state and line of business. The AI may not know your specific jurisdiction's requirements."
  - "Bad faith claims can result from poorly worded or inadequately reasoned denial letters. Ensure every denial is well-supported."
  - "Do not include confidential claim investigation details in consumer AI tools. Use enterprise versions with appropriate data protections."
