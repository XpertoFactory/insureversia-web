prompt: |
  You are an experienced insurance advisor preparing a coverage recommendation letter for a client. Based on the client profile and risk assessment I provide, draft a professional recommendation letter that includes:

  1. **Header**: Your agency name, client name, date, and subject line referencing the coverage review.
  2. **Current Coverage Summary**: Briefly summarize the client's existing coverages, limits, and deductibles.
  3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify the key risks facing this client based on their industry, operations, and profile.
  4. **Coverage Gap Analysis**: For each identified gap between the client's current coverage and their risk exposure, explain:
     - What the gap is
     - Why it matters for this client specifically
     - What could happen if the gap is not addressed (a brief, realistic scenario)
  5. **Recommended Additional Coverages**: For each recommendation, provide:
     - The coverage type and suggested limits
     - Why this coverage is appropriate for the client's risk profile
     - Estimated premium impact (range, if possible, based on general market conditions)
     - Priority level (Critical, Recommended, or Optional)
  6. **Summary Table**: A table listing all recommendations with coverage type, suggested limit, priority, and estimated annual premium range.
  7. **Next Steps**: Suggest a meeting to discuss the recommendations and outline the process for binding additional coverage.

  Tone: Professional, advisory, and client-focused. Explain insurance concepts in plain language.

  Here is the client information:

  Client name: [CLIENT NAME]
  Industry: [INDUSTRY / BUSINESS TYPE]
  Annual revenue: [REVENUE]
  Number of employees: [NUMBER]
  Locations: [LOCATIONS]
  Current coverages: [LIST CURRENT POLICIES WITH LIMITS AND DEDUCTIBLES]
  Recent claims history: [SUMMARY OF CLAIMS IN PAST 3-5 YEARS]
  Known risk concerns: [ANY SPECIFIC RISKS THE CLIENT HAS MENTIONED]
tips:
  - "The more detail you provide about the client's operations, the more targeted the recommendations will be. Include information about their industry, geography, employee count, and any unique exposures."
  - "After generating the letter, follow up with: 'What additional questions should I ask this client to refine these recommendations?' to identify information gaps."
  - "Use this output as a first draft for internal review. Customize premium estimates based on actual market quotes before sending to the client."
  - "Pair this Quick Win with the policy comparison prompt to show the client exactly how their current coverage compares to what you are recommending."
cautions:
  - "Premium estimates generated by AI are approximations based on general knowledge. Always obtain actual quotes from carriers before presenting specific premium figures to clients."
  - "Coverage recommendations must reflect the client's specific risk profile and your professional assessment. Do not rely solely on AI-generated analysis for coverage adequacy opinions."
  - "Regulatory requirements for coverage recommendations vary by jurisdiction. Some states require specific disclosures when recommending or declining to recommend certain coverages."
  - "Do not include confidential client information in consumer AI tools. Use enterprise versions with appropriate data handling agreements."

## What This Quick Win Does

A well-crafted coverage recommendation letter is one of the most valuable deliverables an insurance professional can provide to a client. It demonstrates expertise, builds trust, and helps clients understand why they need specific coverages. However, writing a thorough recommendation letter — one that analyzes current coverage, identifies gaps, and provides risk-based justifications — can take an hour or more per client.

AI can generate a structured first draft in approximately 5 minutes. The output includes a current coverage analysis, gap identification, specific recommendations with priority rankings, and estimated premium impacts. You then refine it with your professional knowledge of the client's business, actual market quotes, and your advisory judgment.

This Quick Win is particularly useful during annual coverage reviews, when onboarding new commercial clients, or when a client's risk profile changes due to growth, new operations, or acquisitions.

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Compile the Client Profile

Before using the prompt, gather:
- Current policy declarations pages (or a summary of all active coverages with limits and deductibles)
- Client's industry, revenue, employee count, and locations
- Claims history for the past 3-5 years
- Any risk concerns the client has raised
- Notes from your most recent conversation about their business operations and plans

The more context you provide, the more tailored the recommendations will be.

### Step 2: Input the Information

Paste the prompt into your AI tool and replace each placeholder with the client's actual information. Be specific — instead of "manufacturing company," write "custom metal fabrication shop with CNC equipment, handling steel and aluminum, with a spray painting booth."

### Step 3: Review the Recommendations

Read the output critically:
- Are the identified gaps genuine for this client's risk profile?
- Are the recommended coverages available in the current market?
- Are the priority rankings appropriate given what you know about the client's risk tolerance and budget?
- Do the premium estimates fall within a reasonable range based on your market experience?

Remove any recommendations that do not apply and add any that the AI missed based on your knowledge of the client.

### Step 4: Customize and Finalize

Replace the AI's estimated premium ranges with actual quotes from carriers. Add client-specific context that only you would know — for example, a planned expansion, a recent incident that did not result in a claim, or a specific contractual requirement from one of their customers. Have the letter reviewed internally before sending to the client.

## What This Does Not Replace

This Quick Win accelerates the drafting process. It does not replace your professional judgment about what coverages a specific client needs, actual market quotes from carriers, or the relationship-based advisory that comes from knowing your client's business personally.
