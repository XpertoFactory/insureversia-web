steps:
  - "Research AI disclosure requirements in every jurisdiction where you operate."
  - "Identify which business processes use AI in ways that may require disclosure."
  - "Draft clear, plain-language disclosure statements for different contexts."

  - "Train staff on when and how to disclose AI use."
  - "Document all disclosures for compliance records."

## Why This Matters

The regulatory trend is unambiguous: AI transparency in insurance is moving from "best practice" to "legal requirement." The NAIC Model Bulletin, Colorado SB 21-169, the EU AI Act, and various state-level initiatives all include transparency and disclosure provisions.

### When to Disclose

**Underwriting decisions**: When AI materially influences risk selection, pricing, or terms. Many jurisdictions are moving toward requiring disclosure when AI plays a significant role in underwriting decisions.

**Claims handling**: When AI is used for claims triage, fraud scoring, or settlement recommendations that affect claim outcomes.

**Customer communications**: When chatbots or AI-generated content is used in direct customer interactions. Customers generally have a right to know they're interacting with AI.

**Regulatory filings**: When submitting rate filings, market conduct reports, or other regulatory documents that were prepared with AI assistance.

### How to Disclose

Keep disclosures clear, specific, and honest. Good disclosure builds trust. Vague or buried disclosure erodes it.

**Good**: "Our underwriting process uses AI-assisted analysis to evaluate risk factors. All AI-generated assessments are reviewed by a licensed underwriter before any decision is made."

**Bad**: "We may use automated tools in our processes." (Too vague to be meaningful.)
