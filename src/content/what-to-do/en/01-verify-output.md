title: "Verify Every AI Output Against Primary Sources"
number: 1
description: "AI tools can generate plausible-sounding insurance analysis that is partially or entirely fabricated. Every AI output must be verified against authoritative sources before it is used in any professional context."
howTo: "Treat every AI output as an unverified first draft. Cross-reference policy language, regulatory citations, actuarial data, and industry statistics against primary sources. Never submit, share, or act on AI-generated content without verification."
steps:
  - "Run your prompt through the AI tool and review the complete output."
  - "Identify every factual claim, regulation reference, policy citation, and data point."
  - "Verify each against primary sources: policy documents, regulatory databases (NAIC, state DOI sites), industry reports."
  - "Check that any statistics or market data cited actually exist and are current."
  - "Confirm that the AI's interpretation of policy language matches industry-standard interpretation."
  - "Document your verification process for compliance records."

  - "ChatGPT / Claude (generation)"
  - "NAIC.org (regulatory verification)"
  - "State DOI websites (state regulation)"
  - "ISO / AAIS (policy forms)"

## Why This Matters

The insurance industry runs on precision. Policy language, coverage determinations, regulatory compliance, and actuarial calculations must be accurate. AI tools — even the best ones — can generate outputs that look authoritative but contain fabricated regulations, misinterpreted policy provisions, or invented statistical data.

### The Verification Habit

Make verification automatic, not optional. The five minutes you spend verifying an AI output can prevent:

- **Regulatory violations** from acting on non-existent or misinterpreted regulations
- **Coverage errors** from AI misreading policy exclusions or conditions
- **Financial exposure** from incorrect reserve calculations or pricing recommendations
- **Professional liability** from relying on AI-generated analysis without due diligence

### What to Verify

**Policy language**: Does the AI accurately quote and interpret the relevant policy provisions? Check against the actual policy document.

**Regulatory references**: Does the regulation actually exist? Is it current? Does it say what the AI claims it says?

**Industry data**: Are the statistics real? Are they from credible sources? Are they current?

**Professional standards**: Does the AI's recommendation align with established industry practices and your organization's guidelines?
