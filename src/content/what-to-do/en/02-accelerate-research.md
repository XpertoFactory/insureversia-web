title: "Use AI to Accelerate Research, Not Replace It"
number: 2
description: "AI excels at quickly surveying broad topics, summarizing complex documents, and identifying relevant information across large datasets. Use it as a research accelerator — a starting point that saves hours of initial groundwork — while keeping your professional expertise in the driver's seat."
howTo: "Use AI to generate initial summaries, identify relevant regulations, survey market trends, and draft research outlines. Then deepen, verify, and refine with primary sources and your professional judgment."
steps:
  - "Define your research question clearly before engaging AI."
  - "Use AI to generate an initial overview or summary of the topic."
  - "Ask AI to identify relevant regulations, industry standards, and key considerations."
  - "Use the AI output as a roadmap — it tells you where to look, not what to conclude."
  - "Conduct your own verification and analysis using primary sources."
  - "Apply your professional judgment to form conclusions and recommendations."

## Why This Matters

Insurance research — whether it's analyzing a new coverage territory, understanding regulatory changes, evaluating emerging risks, or benchmarking market practices — traditionally requires hours of reading, summarizing, and cross-referencing. AI can compress the initial research phase dramatically, often reducing hours of work to minutes.

### The Research Accelerator Model

Think of AI as a highly capable research assistant that:

- **Surveys the landscape** quickly across regulations, industry publications, and general knowledge
- **Summarizes complex documents** into actionable overviews
- **Identifies connections** between topics that you might not have considered
- **Generates initial frameworks** for analysis that you can refine

But like any research assistant, the output needs your expert review. The AI might miss jurisdiction-specific nuances, misunderstand the practical implications of a regulation, or overlook industry-specific context that changes the analysis.

### Example Workflow

Researching whether to offer parametric insurance products in a new market:

1. **AI first pass**: "Summarize the current state of parametric insurance regulation in [jurisdiction], including any specific requirements for trigger mechanisms, policyholder disclosure, and capital reserves."
2. **AI deep dive**: "What are the top 5 operational challenges insurers face when launching parametric products, based on industry experience?"
3. **Your expertise**: Verify regulatory requirements against primary sources, assess operational readiness, evaluate financial viability based on your portfolio context.
