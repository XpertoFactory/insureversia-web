title: "Experiment in Low-Risk Contexts First"
number: 10
description: "The best way to build AI competence is through practice — but not all practice carries the same risk. Start with tasks where errors are easily caught and corrected, then gradually expand to higher-stakes applications as your skills and confidence grow."
howTo: "Begin your AI adoption with low-risk, easily verifiable tasks. Build your skills progressively before applying AI to high-stakes insurance decisions. Document what you learn and share it with your team."
steps:
  - "Identify 3-5 low-risk tasks where you can experiment safely (internal summaries, research, drafting)."
  - "Use AI for these tasks alongside your normal workflow (do it both ways to compare)."
  - "Evaluate: Was the AI output helpful? Accurate? Time-saving?"
  - "Refine your approach based on what you learn."
  - "Gradually expand to moderate-risk tasks with appropriate verification."
  - "Only apply AI to high-risk tasks (regulatory submissions, coverage decisions, customer-facing outputs) after you have strong verification processes in place."

## Why This Matters

Jumping straight to using AI for high-stakes insurance decisions — coverage determinations, regulatory filings, pricing models — before you understand the tool's strengths and limitations is a recipe for costly errors. Building skills progressively protects your organization while still capturing the benefits of AI adoption.

### The Risk Ladder

**Low Risk** (start here):
- Internal research summaries
- Meeting preparation notes
- Training material drafts
- General industry analysis
- Brainstorming and ideation

**Moderate Risk** (move here after gaining confidence):
- First-draft customer communications (always reviewed before sending)
- Internal policy summaries and comparisons
- Claims file summaries for internal use
- Market analysis reports

**Higher Risk** (only with robust verification):
- Coverage analysis and determination support
- Underwriting recommendation support
- Regulatory compliance analysis
- Customer-facing documents and communications
- Any output that influences financial decisions

### The Parallel Run Technique

When you're ready to apply AI to a new task type, run it in parallel with your existing process for the first few iterations. Complete the task the traditional way, then also do it with AI. Compare results. This builds confidence in the AI's capabilities for that specific task while ensuring no quality drop during the transition.
