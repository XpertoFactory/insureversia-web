title: "Leverage AI for Document Review and Data Extraction"
number: 6
description: "Insurance runs on documents — applications, policies, endorsements, claims files, medical records, financial statements. AI can dramatically accelerate the review process by extracting key data points, identifying patterns, and flagging anomalies."
howTo: "Use AI to perform initial document review, extract structured data from unstructured documents, and identify key provisions or anomalies. Always review AI-extracted data for accuracy, especially for coverage-critical provisions."
steps:
  - "Identify the documents to review and the specific information you need extracted."
  - "Use AI to extract key data points: dates, amounts, coverage limits, exclusions, conditions."
  - "Ask AI to summarize the document and flag any unusual provisions or potential issues."
  - "Cross-reference AI-extracted data against the source documents."
  - "Use AI to compare documents (e.g., current policy vs. renewal, competing quotes)."
  - "Document your review process and any corrections to AI-extracted data."

## Why This Matters

Document review is one of the most time-consuming tasks in insurance. Underwriters review applications and loss runs. Claims adjusters review medical records and repair estimates. Compliance officers review regulatory filings. AI can handle the initial extraction and summary, letting you focus on analysis and judgment.

### High-Value Document Review Tasks

**Application review**: Extract key underwriting data points from applications — named insureds, locations, operations descriptions, loss history, requested coverages and limits.

**Policy comparison**: Compare two policy versions to identify changes in coverage, exclusions, conditions, or pricing. Especially valuable for renewals and endorsements.

**Claims file analysis**: Extract key facts from claims documentation — dates of loss, claimant information, injury descriptions, treatment summaries, reserve amounts.

**Regulatory document review**: Summarize new regulations, bulletins, or guidance documents and identify specific impacts on your operations.

### Limitations to Watch For

AI may struggle with:
- Handwritten documents or poor-quality scans
- Complex endorsement stacking and interaction
- Jurisdiction-specific policy form variations
- Implied coverage or coverage by estoppel that requires professional interpretation
