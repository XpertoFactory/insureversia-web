## Why This Matters

The AI tools available to insurance professionals today are the least capable they will ever be. What seems cutting-edge this month may be standard practice next quarter. Professionals who stop learning after their initial AI training will quickly fall behind.

### Trusted Information Sources

**Regulatory**: NAIC bulletins and model laws, state department of insurance updates, EU AI Act implementation guidance, industry association regulatory digests.

**Industry**: Insurance Journal, Business Insurance, Coverager (insurtech focus), AM Best reports on AI adoption, Deloitte/McKinsey/PwC insurance technology reports.

**Technology**: Anthropic and OpenAI blog posts for capability updates, Insureversia for insurance-specific analysis, MIT Technology Review for broader AI developments.

### The Quarterly Review

Every three months, ask yourself:
- Are there new AI tools I should evaluate?
- Have any regulations changed that affect my AI use?
- Are my current prompts and workflows still optimal, or can they be improved?
- What have my peers learned that I can apply?
- Does our organizational AI policy need updating?
