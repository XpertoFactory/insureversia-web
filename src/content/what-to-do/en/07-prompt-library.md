## Why This Matters

Writing a good prompt from scratch every time is inefficient. Once you've found a prompt structure that consistently produces high-quality output for a specific task, you should save it, refine it, and reuse it.

### Organizing Your Library

Organize prompts by:

**Task type**: Claims analysis, underwriting review, customer communication, compliance check, risk assessment, financial analysis.

**Insurance sector**: Property, casualty, liability, workers' comp, auto, professional lines, specialty.

**Output type**: Internal memo, customer letter, analysis report, data extraction, comparison table.

### Example Library Entries

**Claims coverage analysis**:
"You are a claims analyst reviewing a [type] claim under a [policy type] policy in [jurisdiction]. The claim involves [brief facts]. Analyze coverage under the relevant policy provisions. Structure your response as: 1) Applicable coverages, 2) Potential exclusions, 3) Coverage questions requiring investigation, 4) Preliminary recommendation. Flag any uncertainty."

**Renewal communication**:
"Draft a professional renewal communication for a commercial policyholder. Policy type: [type]. Key changes from prior term: [changes]. Premium change: [amount/percentage]. Tone: professional, clear, and relationship-maintaining. Include: summary of changes, explanation of premium adjustment, contact information for questions."

### The Compound Effect

A well-maintained prompt library creates compounding efficiency. Each refined prompt saves you 10-15 minutes per use. Across hundreds of uses per year, the time savings are substantial — and the output quality improves consistently.
