title: "Train Your Team on AI Use"
number: 9
description: "AI competence is a team capability, not an individual skill. If only one person in your organization understands AI, you have a single point of failure. Systematic training ensures consistent, compliant, and effective AI use across your entire team."
howTo: "Develop and implement a structured AI training program for your team. Cover fundamentals, hands-on practice, compliance requirements, and your organization's AI policy. Make training ongoing, not a one-time event."
steps:
  - "Assess your team's current AI knowledge and comfort levels."
  - "Develop a training curriculum covering AI fundamentals, your AI policy, and practical skills."
  - "Start with hands-on exercises using approved tools on real (or realistic) insurance tasks."
  - "Cover compliance requirements specific to your jurisdictions and lines of business."
  - "Create mentorship pairs: team members with AI experience paired with beginners."
  - "Schedule regular knowledge-sharing sessions where team members share AI tips and lessons learned."
  - "Track adoption metrics and adjust training based on what's working."

## Why This Matters

Organizations with uneven AI adoption create risk. When some team members use AI effectively while others avoid it or use it incorrectly, you get inconsistent output quality, compliance gaps, and missed opportunities.

### Training Framework

**Level 1: Foundations** (All staff)
- What AI is and isn't
- Your organization's AI policy
- Approved tools and their proper use
- Data handling and confidentiality requirements
- Basic prompt writing

**Level 2: Practical Skills** (Regular AI users)
- Advanced prompt engineering with the CRAFT framework
- Workflow integration for specific job functions
- Output verification techniques
- Building a personal prompt library

**Level 3: Leadership** (Managers and decision-makers)
- AI strategy and roadmap planning
- Regulatory compliance and risk management
- Vendor evaluation and tool selection
- Measuring AI ROI and adoption metrics

### Making Training Stick

- Use real insurance scenarios, not abstract examples
- Let people practice with actual tools on actual tasks
- Celebrate wins: share when AI saves time or catches something
- Create a safe space for questions and mistakes
- Update training quarterly as tools and regulations evolve
