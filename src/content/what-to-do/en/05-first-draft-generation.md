title: "Use AI for First-Draft Generation"
number: 5
description: "One of AI's highest-value uses in insurance is generating first drafts — of policy summaries, coverage analyses, customer communications, internal memos, and compliance documents. AI handles the blank-page problem and gives you something to refine."
howTo: "Use AI to create initial drafts of common insurance documents. Always review, refine, and personalize the output. The AI writes the first draft; you write the final draft."
steps:
  - "Identify the document type and its audience (internal, customer, regulatory)."
  - "Write a detailed prompt using the CRAFT framework: Context, Role, Action, Format, Tone."
  - "Generate the first draft using AI."
  - "Review the draft critically: verify facts, check policy references, ensure accuracy."
  - "Refine the language, add your professional judgment and specific case details."
  - "Have the final version reviewed by a colleague or supervisor as appropriate."

## Why This Matters

Insurance professionals spend significant time on routine document creation — coverage summaries, denial explanations, renewal communications, audit reports, compliance memos. AI can generate credible first drafts of all of these in minutes, freeing you to focus on the analysis, judgment, and relationship management that requires your expertise.

### Best Candidates for AI First Drafts

**Policy summaries**: Ask AI to summarize a policy in plain language for the policyholder, highlighting key coverages, exclusions, and conditions.

**Coverage analysis memos**: Provide the relevant policy provisions and claim facts; let AI draft the initial coverage analysis for your review.

**Customer communications**: Renewal notices, coverage change explanations, claims status updates — AI can draft these quickly with the right context.

**Internal reports**: Quarterly portfolio reviews, market analysis summaries, team training materials.

**Compliance documents**: Regulatory response drafts, audit preparation materials, policy procedure documentation.

### The Critical Distinction

AI writes the **first** draft. You write the **final** draft. The gap between the two is where your professional value lies — catching errors, adding nuance, ensuring accuracy, and applying judgment that AI cannot replicate.
