title: "Don't Assume Today's Limitations Are Permanent"
number: 10
description: "AI capabilities are advancing at an exponential pace. What AI cannot do today, it may do competently tomorrow. Insurance professionals who dismiss AI based on its current limitations risk being blindsided by rapid improvement."
risk: "Professional obsolescence, competitive disadvantage, failure to adapt practice to evolving capabilities, inability to serve policyholders effectively as the industry transforms"
realExample: "In 2020, AI in insurance was primarily limited to simple chatbots and basic claims triage. By 2023, AI could analyze complex policy documents, generate detailed underwriting assessments, detect fraud patterns across large datasets, and process claims from photos. In 2024, multimodal AI began assessing property damage from images with accuracy comparable to human adjusters. The pace of change consistently outstrips expert predictions, with capabilities arriving years ahead of expectations."
mitigation: "Stay informed about AI developments through trusted sources. Reassess your AI capabilities and workflows quarterly. Build adaptability into your practice — treat AI competence as an evolving skill, not a one-time learning event. Invest in continuous education and experimentation."
insureversiasTake: "In 2020, the 'smart' take was that AI couldn't handle insurance complexity. By 2024, it was writing underwriting memos and detecting fraud. If you build your career strategy on the assumption that AI can't do X, you'd better have a plan for the day it can. I'm not saying AI will replace insurance professionals — I genuinely don't think it will. But it will absolutely reshape what insurance professionals do. The ones who thrive will be those who stopped asking 'Can AI do this?' and started asking 'How can I do this better with AI?'"

## The Danger in Detail

This entry is different from the others. The danger here is not about something you might *do* wrong — it's about something you might *fail to do*: evolve.

### The Pace of Change

Consider this timeline:

- **2020**: AI in insurance was niche — basic chatbots, simple document classification. Most insurance professionals had never interacted with an AI tool.
- **2022**: ChatGPT launched. AI discourse in insurance exploded overnight. Initial reaction was mixed skepticism and curiosity.
- **2023**: AI began producing genuinely useful insurance analysis. NAIC issued the Model Bulletin. Regulators started taking AI governance seriously. Insurtech funding surged.
- **2024**: Specialized insurance AI tools reached production quality. Major carriers integrated AI into underwriting and claims. Multimodal AI started assessing damage from photos. The question shifted from "Can AI help in insurance?" to "Where can't AI help?"
- **2025**: Agentic AI, real-time risk assessment, and AI-native insurance products are emerging. The transformation is accelerating, not slowing.

### What's Changing Next

**Agentic AI**: Systems that autonomously execute multi-step insurance tasks — processing claims from first notice to resolution draft, conducting underwriting analysis across multiple data sources, monitoring compliance across jurisdictions.

**Multimodal intelligence**: AI that processes text, images, video, and sensor data together. Damage assessment from drone footage, risk evaluation from satellite imagery, claims verification from multiple evidence types.

**Real-time underwriting**: Continuous risk assessment using IoT data, weather feeds, and market signals. Dynamic pricing that adjusts to changing risk profiles.

### The Right Mindset

The goal is not to become an AI expert. The goal is to become an adaptable insurance professional who incorporates new capabilities as they mature:

1. **Stay informed**: Follow trusted insurance technology sources.
2. **Experiment regularly**: Try new capabilities in low-risk contexts.
3. **Reassess quarterly**: What AI couldn't do last quarter, it might do now.
4. **Build transferable skills**: Prompt engineering, output evaluation, and workflow integration transfer across tools.
5. **Maintain perspective**: AI is a tool in a long history of tools that have transformed insurance. The professionals who adapted thrived.
