title: "Don't Let AI Write Your Entire Report"
number: 9
description: "AI-generated text has a distinctive quality: it's grammatically perfect, structurally consistent, and frequently generic. Submitting AI-written reports, analyses, or communications without substantial human editing signals to readers that you didn't actually do the work — and may contain errors that a knowledgeable professional would have caught."
risk: "Credibility damage, missed analytical nuances, generic analysis that doesn't address specific circumstances, potential errors in coverage-critical documents, erosion of professional skills"
realExample: "In the legal profession, courts have begun identifying AI-generated briefs not through any technical detection, but through the writing style — overly broad statements, lack of specific case analysis, and a polished but generic quality that lacks the precision of practiced professional writing. The same applies in insurance: regulators, reinsurers, and sophisticated policyholders can often identify AI-generated analysis by its characteristic breadth without depth and its failure to address the specific nuances of a particular risk or claim."
mitigation: "Use AI for first drafts and structured outlines. Then rewrite substantially — add your specific analysis, remove generic filler, include details that only a knowledgeable professional would know, and ensure the final product reflects your actual understanding and judgment."
insureversiasTake: "The tell for AI-generated work isn't grammar errors — it's the absence of specificity. AI writes beautifully about insurance in general. But it can't tell your reader that this particular risk has three factors that make it unusual, or that this claim pattern is consistent with what you saw in the 2019 hailstorm season but with a twist. Your specific knowledge, your pattern recognition from years of experience — that's what separates professional analysis from AI-generated content. Use AI to build the skeleton. You write the substance."

## The Danger in Detail

The temptation is understandable: AI can produce a complete coverage analysis, underwriting memo, or claims report in minutes that would take you hours. The output is well-organized, grammatically correct, and covers all the standard bases. Why not just submit it?

### The Problem with Fully AI-Generated Professional Work

**Generic analysis**: AI writes about the general category of risk or claim, not about your specific case. It can tell you what's generally important about commercial property underwriting — but it can't tell you about the specific exposure pattern you noticed in the applicant's loss runs.

**Missing nuance**: AI doesn't know what you know. It doesn't have your experience with this type of risk, this policyholder, this market, this regulatory environment. That experiential knowledge is what makes professional analysis valuable.

**Detectable quality**: Readers who work in insurance can increasingly identify AI-generated content. It has a characteristic quality — thorough but generic, correct but not insightful. When a regulator, reinsurer, or sophisticated client reads it, they know.

**Skills erosion**: If you consistently let AI do the analytical heavy lifting, your own analytical skills atrophy. Professional competence requires practice. AI should augment your capabilities, not replace them.

### The Rewrite Protocol

1. **AI generates the first draft**: structure, outline, standard analysis points.
2. **You rewrite for specificity**: add case-specific details, your professional observations, experiential insights.
3. **You challenge the analysis**: Does the AI's conclusion hold up given what you know about this specific situation?
4. **You add what AI can't**: your professional judgment, your knowledge of this particular policyholder/claimant/market.
5. **The final product is yours**: it should read like work that only someone with your expertise could have produced.
