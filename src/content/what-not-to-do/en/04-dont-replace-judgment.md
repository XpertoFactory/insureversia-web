title: "Don't Use AI to Replace Professional Judgment"
number: 4
description: "AI can analyze data, identify patterns, and generate recommendations. But it cannot exercise the professional judgment that comes from years of experience, deep understanding of context, and the ethical obligations that define insurance practice."
risk: "Poor underwriting decisions, unfair claims outcomes, regulatory non-compliance, professional liability, erosion of core competencies"
realExample: "In 2021, the Stanford Digital Economy Lab published research showing that AI-driven insurance pricing models can inadvertently discriminate against protected classes through proxy variables — ZIP codes that correlate with race, credit scores that correlate with socioeconomic status, and health data that correlates with disability. Regulators in Colorado, New York, and the EU have explicitly stated that 'the algorithm made the decision' is not an acceptable defense for discriminatory outcomes. Human judgment remains the required check on algorithmic recommendations."
mitigation: "Use AI to inform your professional judgment, not replace it. AI generates analysis and recommendations; you make the decisions. Always review AI-generated recommendations against your professional experience, ethical obligations, and regulatory requirements before acting on them."
insureversiasTake: "Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI can process more data faster than you ever will. But it cannot understand what a claim means to the person filing it. It cannot weigh the ethical implications of a pricing decision. It cannot sense when an underwriting guideline, while technically correct, would produce an outcome that violates the spirit of insurance as a social good. That judgment is yours. AI is the most powerful research assistant you've ever had. But it is never the decision-maker. You are."

## The Danger in Detail

The line between "AI-assisted decisions" and "AI-made decisions" is easier to cross than you think. When AI consistently produces reasonable recommendations, it's tempting to stop scrutinizing them. Over time, the human in the loop becomes the human who clicks "approve."

### Where Professional Judgment Is Irreplaceable

**Underwriting**: AI can analyze risk factors and suggest pricing. But the underwriter must consider the applicant's full context, the relationship value, the portfolio balance, and whether the algorithmic recommendation aligns with the organization's risk appetite and ethical standards.

**Claims handling**: AI can triage claims, flag potential fraud, and suggest reserves. But the claims adjuster must consider the claimant's circumstances, assess credibility through human interaction, and ensure that the claims process treats policyholders fairly.

**Compliance**: AI can monitor regulatory changes and flag potential issues. But the compliance officer must interpret how regulations apply to specific business practices, assess risk tolerance, and make judgment calls about ambiguous requirements.

**Customer relationships**: AI can draft communications and suggest products. But building trust, understanding client needs, and providing empathetic service during difficult moments requires human connection.

### The Accountability Principle

Regulators have made this unambiguous: organizations are responsible for AI-informed decisions the same as any other decision. The NAIC Model Bulletin, Colorado SB 21-169, and the EU AI Act all require human accountability for AI-assisted decisions in insurance.
