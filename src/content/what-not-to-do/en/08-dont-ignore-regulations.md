title: "Don't Ignore Regulatory Guidelines on AI"
number: 8
description: "Insurance regulators across the United States and internationally are issuing AI-specific guidance at an accelerating pace. These are not suggestions — they are requirements that carry real consequences for non-compliance."
risk: "Regulatory penalties, market conduct violations, increased examination scrutiny, license restrictions, forced corrective action plans"
realExample: "Colorado's SB 21-169 (effective 2023) requires insurers to test AI and algorithmic systems for unfair discrimination and submit governance frameworks to the Division of Insurance. The NAIC Model Bulletin (December 2023) establishes expectations for AI governance across all insurance functions. Multiple state departments of insurance have begun incorporating AI governance questions into market conduct examinations. Insurers that cannot demonstrate compliance with applicable AI governance requirements face corrective action, increased examination frequency, and potential penalties."
mitigation: "Identify and review all AI-related regulatory guidance applicable to your jurisdictions immediately. Subscribe to regulatory updates from NAIC and your state DOIs. If your jurisdiction hasn't issued specific AI guidance yet, apply existing fair practices, data privacy, and consumer protection regulations to your AI use. Document your compliance."
insureversiasTake: "I know — 'read the regulatory guidance' sounds about as exciting as 'read the policy jacket.' But here's the reality: these regulations are your playbook. When something goes wrong with AI — and for someone, eventually, it will — the first question the regulator will ask is 'Did you follow the applicable guidance?' If your answer is 'I didn't know there was any,' you've already lost. The NAIC Model Bulletin, Colorado SB 21-169, and the EU AI Act are the big three right now. Read them. Build your governance around them. They're actually quite reasonable."

## The Danger in Detail

The insurance regulatory landscape for AI is evolving rapidly. In the span of roughly 18 months (mid-2023 to end of 2024), the AI governance landscape went from near-silence to a comprehensive body of guidance.

### The Current Landscape

**National level (U.S.)**:
- NAIC Model Bulletin on AI (December 2023) — the most significant guidance, addressing AI governance across underwriting, pricing, claims, and marketing.
- NAIC Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Working Group — ongoing development of additional guidance and model laws.

**State level (partial list)**:
- Colorado SB 21-169 — specific algorithmic testing and governance requirements.
- New York Circular Letter — expectations for AI use in underwriting and pricing.
- Connecticut, California, and multiple other states — varying levels of guidance and regulatory focus.

**International**:
- EU AI Act — classifies certain insurance AI applications as high-risk.
- UK FCA — guidance on AI use in financial services including insurance.
- Singapore MAS — FEAT principles for AI in financial services.

### The "Existing Rules Apply" Principle

One critical insight: AI-specific regulations are not new obligations — they are applications of existing obligations to new technology. Fair pricing requirements, anti-discrimination laws, data privacy regulations, and consumer protection standards already apply to AI-driven decisions even without AI-specific guidance.

### Action Steps

1. **Find your regulators' guidance**: Search your state DOI website for "artificial intelligence" or "algorithmic."
2. **Read the NAIC Model Bulletin**: It applies broadly even if your state hasn't formally adopted it.
3. **Map regulations to practices**: For each AI use case, identify the applicable regulatory requirements.
4. **Build a compliance framework**: Document your AI governance, testing, and oversight procedures.
5. **Monitor for changes**: Subscribe to regulatory update services and review quarterly.
