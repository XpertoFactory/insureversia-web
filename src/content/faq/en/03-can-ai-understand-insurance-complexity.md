AI does not "understand" insurance the way a seasoned professional does — but it does not need to in order to be profoundly useful. The key is knowing what AI handles well and where human expertise remains essential.

**What AI does remarkably well:**

- **Document analysis:** AI can process and summarize lengthy policy wordings, endorsements, and regulatory filings with high accuracy. It excels at identifying specific clauses, exclusions, and conditions across hundreds of pages.
- **Pattern recognition:** AI detects patterns in claims data, loss histories, and risk factors that human analysts might miss. It can identify emerging trends across thousands of data points simultaneously.
- **Regulatory research:** AI can rapidly scan regulatory updates across multiple jurisdictions and flag relevant changes for specific lines of business.
- **Routine drafting:** First drafts of standard correspondence, policy summaries, and claims acknowledgment letters are well within AI capabilities.

**Where AI falls short:**

- **Professional judgment:** Assessing whether a borderline claim should be covered requires contextual understanding that AI lacks.
- **Relationship nuance:** Reading a client's emotional state during a catastrophic loss, or understanding the unspoken concerns in a renewal negotiation, remains human territory.
- **Novel situations:** Emerging risks — cyber, climate, pandemic — often lack the historical data AI needs to perform reliably.
- **Ethical reasoning:** Decisions about fairness, equity, and social impact require moral reasoning AI cannot perform.

The Swiss Re Institute characterizes AI as a "powerful tool for the 80% of insurance work that is information processing, freeing professionals to focus on the 20% that requires true expertise." The professionals who will thrive are those who leverage AI for the routine and reserve their expertise for the complex.
