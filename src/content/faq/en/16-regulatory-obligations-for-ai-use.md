The regulatory landscape for AI in insurance is evolving rapidly. Here is what you need to know about current obligations and emerging requirements.

**NAIC Model Bulletin (United States):**
The NAIC's December 2023 Model Bulletin is the primary US guidance. Key requirements include:
- Insurers must maintain governance frameworks for AI use.
- AI-driven decisions must comply with existing unfair discrimination laws.
- Outcomes-based testing is expected to ensure AI does not produce unfairly discriminatory results.
- Insurers are responsible for third-party AI models and vendor tools.
- Documentation and audit trails are required for AI-assisted decisions.

**State Department of Insurance Guidance:**
Individual states are implementing their own requirements. Colorado's SB 21-169 specifically addresses algorithmic discrimination in insurance. Connecticut, New York, and California have issued or proposed AI-specific guidance for insurers. Monitor your state DOI for jurisdiction-specific obligations.

**EU AI Act (International Operations):**
The EU AI Act classifies insurance AI applications as "high-risk" when they influence underwriting, claims, or pricing decisions. Requirements include:
- Mandatory risk assessments for high-risk AI systems.
- Transparency obligations for AI-driven decisions affecting consumers.
- Human oversight requirements.
- Record-keeping and documentation mandates.
- Potential fines up to 6% of global annual turnover for non-compliance.

**Key documentation requirements across frameworks:**
1. What AI tools are being used and for what purposes.
2. How models were tested for bias and fairness.
3. What human oversight processes are in place.
4. How consumer complaints about AI-driven decisions are handled.
5. Vendor management and third-party AI oversight protocols.

**The practical imperative:** Regulatory enforcement is accelerating. The cost of compliance is far less than the cost of penalties and remediation. Build governance now, not after an enforcement action.
