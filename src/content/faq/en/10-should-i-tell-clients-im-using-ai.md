The short answer: transparency builds trust, and in many contexts, disclosure may be legally required. Here is a framework for navigating this question.

**When disclosure is mandatory or strongly advised:**

- **Automated decision-making:** If AI is used to make or significantly influence underwriting decisions, claims determinations, pricing, or coverage eligibility, most regulatory frameworks require disclosure. The NAIC Model Bulletin explicitly addresses this.
- **Adverse actions:** If an AI-influenced decision results in a coverage denial, rate increase, or claims denial, the basis for that decision must be explainable and disclosed to the consumer.
- **State-specific requirements:** Several states (Colorado, Connecticut, and others) have enacted or proposed AI-specific disclosure requirements for insurance. Check your jurisdiction.

**When disclosure is recommended but not required:**

- Using AI to draft correspondence that you review and personalize.
- Leveraging AI for internal research, analysis, or workflow efficiency.
- Employing AI tools as part of your professional toolkit, similar to using policy management software.

**Best practices for transparency:**

1. **Be proactive, not reactive.** If clients ask, never deny AI use. Dishonesty about tools erodes trust far more than the tools themselves.
2. **Frame it as quality enhancement.** "We use AI-assisted tools to enhance our research and analysis capabilities, and every output is reviewed by our professional team."
3. **Document your AI use.** Maintain records of when and how AI was used in client-facing work.
4. **Follow your organization's disclosure policy.** If your carrier or agency lacks one, advocate for creating one.

J.D. Power data shows that 67% of insurance consumers are comfortable with AI use when it is disclosed transparently, but trust drops significantly when they discover undisclosed AI involvement after the fact.
