Measuring AI ROI in insurance requires tracking both quantitative efficiency gains and qualitative improvements. Here are the metrics that matter most, organized by function.

**Time Efficiency Metrics:**
- **Processing speed:** Measure time-to-completion for AI-assisted tasks vs. manual baselines. Claims processing, underwriting review, and document analysis are the clearest comparisons.
- **Throughput increase:** Track volume of policies reviewed, claims processed, or documents analyzed per period.
- **McKinsey benchmark:** Insurers report 30-50% time savings in claims processing and 20-40% in underwriting review.

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Error reduction:** Compare error rates in AI-assisted work vs. pre-AI baselines. Track policy drafting errors, claims coding mistakes, and compliance oversights.
- **Consistency:** Measure variation in outputs across similar cases. AI tends to produce more consistent first drafts than manual processes.
- **Rework rate:** Track how often AI-assisted deliverables require significant revision.

**Financial Metrics:**
- **Cost per transaction:** Calculate the all-in cost of processing a claim, underwriting a policy, or handling a customer inquiry with and without AI.
- **Loss ratio improvement:** Track whether AI-assisted underwriting correlates with improved loss ratios over time.
- **Compliance cost:** Measure reduction in regulatory penalties, remediation costs, and audit preparation time.

**Client and Stakeholder Metrics:**
- **Client satisfaction:** Survey clients on response times, communication quality, and overall service experience.
- **Employee satisfaction:** Track team engagement and satisfaction with AI-assisted workflows.
- **Retention metrics:** Monitor whether AI tools correlate with improved policyholder retention rates.

**Practical measurement approach:**
Start with a baseline before AI implementation. Track three to five key metrics for 90 days pre-AI and 90 days post-AI. Be honest about confounding variables. Capgemini recommends focusing on time savings and error reduction as the most reliable early indicators, then expanding to financial metrics as data matures.
