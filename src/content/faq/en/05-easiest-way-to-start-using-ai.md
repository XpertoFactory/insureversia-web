Start small, start safe, and start today. The most effective approach is to pick one low-risk task you already do regularly and try using AI for it.

**Step 1: Choose a free AI tool.** ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), or Gemini (Google) all have free tiers. You do not need to spend money to begin learning. Create an account with any of them — it takes two minutes.

**Step 2: Pick a low-risk, non-confidential task.** Good starting points for insurance professionals include:

- Summarizing a publicly available regulatory update
- Drafting a template email for policy renewal reminders
- Simplifying complex policy language into plain English
- Creating a checklist for a claims review process
- Brainstorming questions for a risk assessment

**Step 3: Write a clear prompt.** Tell the AI your role, the task, and what format you want the output in. For example: *"You are an insurance professional. Summarize the key changes in [specific regulation] in bullet points, focusing on implications for commercial property insurers."*

**Step 4: Evaluate the output critically.** AI will produce confident-sounding text that may contain errors. Check every fact, verify regulatory references, and never use AI output without review.

**Step 5: Iterate and improve.** If the first result is not what you need, refine your prompt. Add more context, specify constraints, or ask for a different format.

The Quick Wins section on Insureversia provides ready-made exercises with tested prompts designed specifically for insurance professionals. Each takes minutes to complete and teaches you a practical AI skill without requiring any technical background.

PwC's research shows that professionals who start with small, concrete tasks are three times more likely to become consistent AI users than those who attempt ambitious projects first.
