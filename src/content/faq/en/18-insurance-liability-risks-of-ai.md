AI adoption creates new liability exposures that insurance organizations must understand and actively manage. Here are the primary risk categories.

**Errors and Omissions (E&O) Exposure:**
If AI-generated advice, coverage analysis, or claims determinations prove incorrect and cause policyholder harm, the insurer or agency faces E&O liability. The standard of care has not changed — using AI does not diminish the professional's obligation to deliver accurate, competent work. AI errors are your errors if you rely on them without verification.

**Unfair Discrimination and Bias:**
AI models trained on historical data may perpetuate or amplify existing biases in underwriting, pricing, and claims handling. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing AI-driven decisions for disparate impact on protected classes. The NAIC Model Bulletin explicitly requires insurers to test AI systems for unfairly discriminatory outcomes.

**Regulatory Penalties:**
Non-compliance with emerging AI regulations carries real financial consequences. Fines for inadequate AI governance, failure to document AI-driven decisions, or using AI in ways that violate consumer protection laws are becoming more common. The EU AI Act imposes fines up to 6% of global revenue for serious violations.

**Reputational Risk:**
Publicized AI failures — biased underwriting algorithms, incorrectly denied claims, data breaches from AI systems — can damage brand trust and market position. In insurance, trust is the product. Reputational damage from AI misuse can be harder to recover from than financial penalties.

**Mitigation strategies:**

1. **Implement robust governance** before deploying AI in production.
2. **Test for bias** regularly using diverse datasets and outcome analysis.
3. **Maintain human oversight** for all AI-assisted decisions affecting policyholders.
4. **Document everything** — the tool used, the input, the output, and the human review.
5. **Review your own E&O coverage** to ensure AI-related exposures are addressed.

Swiss Re emphasizes that the greatest liability risk is not from using AI, but from using it without adequate governance, testing, and oversight.
