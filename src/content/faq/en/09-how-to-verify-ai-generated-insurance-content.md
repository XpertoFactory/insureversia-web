Verification is non-negotiable. Every piece of AI-generated content in insurance must be reviewed before it is used, shared, or relied upon. Here is a practical verification checklist.

**Regulatory Accuracy Check:**
- Cross-reference any regulatory citations against official sources (state DOI websites, NAIC publications, federal registers).
- Verify statute numbers, effective dates, and jurisdictional applicability.
- AI frequently cites regulations that do not exist or conflates requirements from different jurisdictions.

**Policy Language Review:**
- Compare AI-drafted policy language against approved ISO forms, proprietary wordings, and your organization's style guide.
- Check for unintended coverage grants or exclusion gaps.
- Ensure defined terms are used consistently and correctly.

**Claims and Coverage Analysis:**
- Verify that coverage determinations reference the actual policy provisions at issue.
- Confirm that reserves, damage estimates, or liability assessments align with established guidelines.
- Check that AI has not overlooked relevant endorsements, amendments, or sublimits.

**Source Verification:**
- If AI cites case law, industry reports, or statistics, verify each citation independently.
- AI is known to fabricate convincing-sounding citations — a phenomenon called "hallucination."
- Use primary sources, not the AI's summary, for any external-facing content.

**Professional Judgment Layer:**
- Ask yourself: does this output reflect what a competent insurance professional would produce?
- Consider edge cases, exceptions, and nuances that AI may have oversimplified.
- Never let AI output override your professional expertise.

The NAIC Model Bulletin emphasizes that insurers bear full responsibility for AI outputs, regardless of whether a human or machine generated the content. Verification is not just best practice — it is a regulatory and professional obligation.
