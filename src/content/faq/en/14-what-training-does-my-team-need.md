Effective AI training for insurance teams is not about making everyone a data scientist. It is about building practical competency at the right level for each role. Here is a structured approach.

**Level 1 — AI Literacy (All Staff, 4-8 hours):**
Every team member needs foundational understanding: what AI can and cannot do, data privacy obligations, your organization's AI usage policy, and basic prompt engineering. This is non-negotiable — uninformed users create the most risk.

**Level 2 — Practical Application (Active Users, 8-16 hours):**
Staff who will use AI regularly need hands-on training with approved tools. Cover prompt engineering techniques, output verification workflows, common pitfalls, and role-specific use cases. Include supervised practice sessions, not just lectures.

**Level 3 — Advanced Integration (Power Users, 16-40 hours):**
Team leaders and AI champions need deeper skills: workflow automation, custom prompt libraries, quality assurance frameworks, and the ability to evaluate new AI tools. These individuals become internal resources for their colleagues.

**Level 4 — Strategic Leadership (Executives, 8-16 hours):**
Leaders need to understand AI's strategic implications: competitive landscape, regulatory trajectory, investment decisions, vendor evaluation, and governance responsibilities. Focus on decision-making frameworks rather than technical details.

**Recommended learning paths:**

- Start with Insureversia's AI 101 for foundational knowledge.
- Use Quick Wins for hands-on practice in real insurance scenarios.
- Complete the Prompt Engineering guide for communication skills with AI.
- Periodic refreshers as tools and regulations evolve.

**Measuring competence:** The Institutes recommend practical assessments over written tests. Can the team member use AI to complete a relevant task accurately and safely? That is the competency standard.

Accenture data suggests 20-30 hours of focused training is sufficient to bring an insurance professional from AI-novice to competent user. The key is quality of instruction and relevance to their actual work, not volume of content.
