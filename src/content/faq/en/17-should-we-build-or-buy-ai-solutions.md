The build vs. buy decision depends on your organization's size, technical capacity, and specific needs. Here is a practical framework.

**When to buy (most organizations):**
- **You are a small to mid-size agency or carrier.** Off-the-shelf AI tools and SaaS platforms are almost always more cost-effective than custom development. General-purpose tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot handle 80% of use cases.
- **You need fast time-to-value.** Commercial AI tools are ready today. Custom development takes 6-18 months minimum.
- **You lack in-house technical talent.** Building AI requires data engineers, ML specialists, and ongoing maintenance. Most insurance organizations do not have and should not build these teams.

**When to build (large carriers and reinsurers):**
- **You have proprietary data advantages.** If your organization has unique datasets that could create competitive advantage (decades of claims data, proprietary risk models), custom AI may unlock value that generic tools cannot.
- **You need deep integration.** When AI must embed seamlessly into existing policy administration, claims management, or underwriting systems, custom integration may be necessary.
- **Regulatory requirements demand it.** Some jurisdictions may require AI systems that are fully auditable and explainable — custom builds offer more transparency and control.

**Vendor evaluation criteria:**
1. **Data privacy:** Where is data processed and stored? What are the contractual commitments?
2. **Insurance expertise:** Does the vendor understand insurance-specific use cases and regulatory requirements?
3. **Integration capability:** Can the tool connect with your existing technology stack?
4. **Total cost of ownership:** Include licensing, training, integration, maintenance, and opportunity costs.
5. **Exit strategy:** What happens to your data and workflows if you switch vendors?

**The hybrid approach:** Gartner recommends starting with commercial tools for general tasks and evaluating custom development only for high-value, proprietary use cases where off-the-shelf solutions demonstrably fall short. This minimizes risk while keeping options open.
