An AI governance framework is the foundational document that guides responsible AI use across your organization. Without one, adoption is ad hoc, risk is unmanaged, and regulatory compliance is uncertain. Here are the essential components.

**1. AI Usage Policy:**
Define what AI tools are approved for use, what tasks they may be used for, and what restrictions apply. Specify which tools are authorized at each data classification level (public, internal, confidential, restricted). This is your most critical governance document.

**2. Approved Tool Registry:**
Maintain a vetted list of AI tools that meet your organization's security, privacy, and compliance requirements. Include version information, data processing agreements, and renewal dates. Unapproved tools should be explicitly prohibited.

**3. Data Classification Framework:**
Establish clear categories for data sensitivity and map each category to appropriate AI tools. Policyholder PII and PHI require enterprise-grade or local AI only. Public regulatory information can be processed with consumer tools.

**4. Training Requirements:**
Define minimum AI competency standards for different roles. Underwriters, claims adjusters, compliance officers, and customer service staff will have different training needs. Include both initial certification and ongoing education requirements.

**5. Audit Trail and Documentation:**
Require documentation of AI-assisted decisions, especially those affecting policyholders. Record what tool was used, what inputs were provided, what outputs were generated, and what human review occurred.

**6. Review and Update Cycle:**
AI capabilities and regulations change rapidly. Commit to quarterly reviews of your governance framework and immediate updates when significant regulatory changes occur.

The NAIC Model Bulletin provides a baseline expectation that insurers maintain governance frameworks proportional to their AI use. Oliver Wyman recommends that governance be a living document — not a shelf document — with active enforcement and regular updates.
