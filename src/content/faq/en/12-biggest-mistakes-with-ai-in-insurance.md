Based on documented cases and industry research, here are the five most common and consequential mistakes insurance professionals make with AI.

**1. Trusting AI output without verification.**
This is the single most dangerous mistake. AI generates confident text regardless of accuracy. Professionals who treat AI output as final product rather than first draft expose themselves to errors in coverage analysis, regulatory compliance, and client communications. Every AI output requires human review.

**2. Inputting confidential data into consumer AI tools.**
Entering policyholder PII, claims details, medical records, or proprietary underwriting data into ChatGPT or similar consumer platforms violates data privacy obligations and potentially exposes your organization to regulatory penalties. Use enterprise or local AI solutions for confidential work.

**3. Over-relying on AI for complex judgment calls.**
AI excels at routine tasks but struggles with novel, ambiguous, or ethically complex situations. Using AI to make coverage determinations on complex claims, assess bad faith exposure, or evaluate emerging risks without substantive human judgment is a recipe for errors with significant consequences.

**4. Ignoring regulatory requirements.**
Many professionals adopt AI tools without understanding the regulatory landscape. The NAIC Model Bulletin, state DOI guidance, and emerging legislation create real compliance obligations. Ignorance is not a defense.

**5. Failing to document AI use.**
When AI contributes to a coverage decision, claims determination, or underwriting assessment, there should be a record of what tool was used, what prompts were given, and how the output was reviewed. Without documentation, defending those decisions becomes significantly harder.

**The common thread:** All five mistakes stem from treating AI as a replacement for professional judgment rather than a tool that amplifies it. For detailed guidance on avoiding these pitfalls, explore Insureversia's What Not To Do section.
