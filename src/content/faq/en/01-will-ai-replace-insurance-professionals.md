No. AI will not replace insurance professionals, but it will fundamentally reshape what they do and how they do it.

**What AI does well in insurance:** AI excels at processing large volumes of data, identifying patterns in claims history, automating routine document review, and generating first drafts of policy language. It can analyze thousands of claims in minutes, flag potential fraud indicators, and streamline underwriting workflows that previously took hours.

**What AI cannot do:** Insurance requires professional judgment that AI simply cannot replicate. Assessing the nuance of a complex commercial risk, building trust with a policyholder after a devastating loss, navigating ambiguous regulatory requirements, and making ethical decisions about coverage and claims — these remain deeply human capabilities.

**The real shift is augmentation, not replacement.** McKinsey estimates that while up to 25% of insurance tasks could be automated, this frees professionals to focus on higher-value work: client relationships, complex risk assessment, strategic advising, and creative problem-solving.

The insurance professionals most at risk are not those who will be replaced by AI. They are those who will be outperformed by professionals who use AI effectively. The role is evolving from data processor to strategic advisor, and AI is the catalyst making that transition possible.

Deloitte's 2024 survey found that 79% of insurance executives view AI as augmenting their workforce rather than replacing it. The message is clear: learn to work with AI, and your value increases.
