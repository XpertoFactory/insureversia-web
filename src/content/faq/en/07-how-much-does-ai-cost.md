The cost ranges from zero to millions, depending on your approach. The good news is that meaningful AI adoption can start for free and scale gradually based on proven value.

**Free Tier (Individual Start):**
ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all offer free versions with significant capabilities. An individual insurance professional can begin using AI today at no cost, handling tasks like document summarization, draft correspondence, regulatory research, and brainstorming. This is the recommended starting point.

**Professional Tier ($20-50/month per user):**
Premium versions of AI assistants (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Gemini Advanced) offer more powerful models, longer context windows, and priority access. Microsoft Copilot for business adds AI across Office 365 for approximately $30/month per user. For a small team of five, expect $100-250/month.

**Specialized Tools ($500-5,000/month):**
Insurance-specific platforms like claims analysis tools, underwriting assistants, and compliance monitoring systems typically run $500-5,000/month depending on scale and features. These often require annual contracts.

**Enterprise AI ($50,000-500,000+/year):**
Full enterprise deployments — custom models, API integrations, on-premises installations, and workflow automation — represent significant investment. Large carriers and reinsurers are committing budgets at this level.

**ROI expectations:**
McKinsey data suggests that well-implemented AI in insurance typically delivers 3-5x return on investment within 18 months. The strongest returns come from claims processing efficiency (30-50% time savings), underwriting speed improvements, and reduced error rates.

**The best advice: start free, prove value, then invest.** Document your time savings and quality improvements with free tools before committing budget. The business case will make itself.
