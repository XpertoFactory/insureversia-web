No. You do not need coding, data science, or technical engineering skills to use AI effectively in insurance work. The most important skill is one you can learn in an afternoon: prompt engineering.

**What is prompt engineering?** It is the practice of writing clear, structured instructions (prompts) that guide AI to produce useful output. Think of it as learning to communicate effectively with a very capable but literal-minded research assistant. The better your instructions, the better the results.

**The key skills for insurance professionals using AI:**

1. **Clear communication:** Describe your task, provide context, specify the output format, and set constraints. Example: *"Summarize this policy exclusion clause in plain English suitable for a commercial policyholder. Limit to 150 words."*
2. **Critical evaluation:** Assess AI output for accuracy, completeness, and relevance. This is where your insurance expertise becomes invaluable — you know what a correct answer looks like.
3. **Iterative refinement:** Learn to adjust prompts when the output is not quite right. Add context, narrow the scope, or provide examples of what you want.
4. **Data awareness:** Understand what information is safe to share with AI and what must remain confidential.

**What you do NOT need:**

- Programming or coding skills
- Understanding of machine learning algorithms
- Technical setup or configuration expertise
- A computer science background

The Institutes note that prompt engineering is rapidly becoming a core professional competency alongside traditional insurance skills. Insureversia's Prompt Engineering guide provides a comprehensive, insurance-specific learning path that requires zero technical background.
