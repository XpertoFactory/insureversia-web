  },
  {
    term: 'Loss Ratio',
    definition: 'A fundamental insurance metric calculated as incurred losses plus loss adjustment expenses divided by earned premiums. The loss ratio measures the percentage of premiums paid out in claims.

  },
  {
    term: 'Token',
    definition: 'The basic unit of text processed by large language models. A token can be a word, part of a word, or a punctuation mark.

  },
  {
    term: 'Training Data',
    definition: 'The dataset used to teach an AI model to recognize patterns and make predictions. The quality, representativeness, and scope of training data fundamentally determine model performance.
