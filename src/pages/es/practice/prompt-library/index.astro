              <strong>Always specify your jurisdiction</strong> and applicable regulatory framework to avoid responses that mix requirements from different states.

              <strong>Include relevant policy forms</strong> and ISO form numbers when analyzing coverage to ensure accurate and specific responses.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: var(--space-2) 0;">
              <strong>Add constraints</strong> when needed: "reference only current NAIC model laws," "limit to admitted market carriers," "exclude surplus lines considerations."

            <li style="padding: var(--space-2) 0;">
              <strong>Verify all output</strong>. These prompts produce high-quality drafts, but every reference to policy language, regulations, ISO forms, and NAIC standards must be confirmed against primary sources.

              <strong>Save your improved versions</strong>. As you refine prompts for your specific line of business or carrier, build your own personalized library.
